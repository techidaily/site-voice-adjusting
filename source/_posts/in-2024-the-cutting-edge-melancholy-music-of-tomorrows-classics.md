One of the benefits of using background music with Filmora is that there is a royalty-free Audio library that provides different genres of background music and sound effects. So, if you don’t want to find and download music from websites, just check the Audio Library in Filmora. Click the music thumbnail in the Media pane, and then drag and drop it to the track in the timeline pane.

## **Method 1: Remove Vocals Using Audacity Vocal Reduction Tool**

The first method of removing vocals in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is using the built-in vocal remover. This method is effective in completely removing vocals depending on how much processing is on the vocal. Even if the vocals are not completely removed, the method will reduce the volume significantly to give you great results. Let’s have a look at how to isolate vocal audacity with this method.

### **Step 1: Open Audacity**

The first thing you need to do is open the Audacity software in preparation for the vocal removal.

![open audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-1.JPG)

### **Step 2: Import the Audio Track**

Go to File > Import > Audio to import the audio track you want to edit.

![import audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-2.JPG)

### **Step 3: Select Audio Track**

Select the song or audio track from which you want to remove the vocals. This allows Audacity to load the waveform of the track into the editor.

![file import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-3.JPG)

### **Step 4: Export as MP3**

Backup the file so that you still have the whole song available for use later. Go to File > Export > Export as MP3\. Audacity will export the track in the original file format. If it was a WAV audio file, the export will be to that type. This ensures that the audio artifacts are kept in the best condition for editing. Be sure to name the exported file in something you will easily remember.

![export audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-4.JPG)

### **Step 5: Import the New Audio File**

Once you have exported the audio file, click “Close “on the original file. Then import the file you exported in the last step.

![import new audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-5.JPG)

### **Step 6: Apply Vocal Reduction and Isolation**

![apply vocal reduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-6.JPG)

### **Step 7: Remove Vocals**

![remove vocals](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-7.JPG)

This method is a quick and easy way to remove vocals from any song in Audacity. It works best with any kind of song and will produce the edited track in just a matter of minutes. On the drawback, this method does not always wholly remove vocal and you may at times still hear bits of it. It may also remove other elements of the audio in addition to the vocal. Nonetheless, it is an effective approach that will work most of the time.

## **Method 2: Remove Vocals Using Audacity Splitting Audio Channels**

When working with songs or audio tracks with vocals in one channel and instruments in another, this is the best method to use. The Audacity vocal remover plugin gives you a simple way to separate the vocals and other sounds in an audio file. However, you cannot tell song that has multiple channels simply by looking at or listening to it. Therefore, you can try this method with any of your files and see the quality of the outcome.
