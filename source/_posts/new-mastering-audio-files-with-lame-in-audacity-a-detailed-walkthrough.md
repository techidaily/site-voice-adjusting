## Part 2: 3 Tips for Choosing an Automatic Transcription Software

The features of automatic transcription software products offer vary, which is the reason why checking the software’s list of features is the first thing you need to do while searching for a new automatic transcription software. The accuracy with which a software transcribes audio and video files, the amount of text editing tools it offers, or the number of supported languages are just a few among numerous aspects you have to consider before deciding which automatic transcription software you should get.

You don’t have to worry about the software’s compatibility, as you just need a web browser to use any of the automatic subscription software products we featured in this article. However, if you want to transcribe audio and video files from your Smartphone, you should check if the app is compatible with your device and its operating system.

There are only a handful of automatic transcription software products on the market that can be used free of charge, which is why you need to decide if you want to pay per minute of transcription or get a monthly subscription. So, if you are transcribing hundreds of hours of audio and video content each month, it is more affordable to purchase a monthly subscription while paying per minute of transcription is a better option if you don’t transcribe audio and video files often.

### Part 3: Automatic Transcription Software FAQs

#### What is Automatic Transcription?

Automatic transcription is the process during which AI algorithms listen to an audio or video file and transcribe it into text. All automatic transcription software products are equipped with a Speech-to-Text technology that generates text with varying levels of accuracy. That’s the reason why nearly all automatic transcription software products have text editors that allow you to identify and correct mistakes quickly.

#### What are the Biggest Benefits of Automatic Transcription?

Transcribing an audio or video file manually can take a lot of time and effort, while automatic transcription allows you to generate a transcript in just a few minutes. Afterward, you can just edit the text and use it to access important information quickly or upload it to your website in order to increase its visibility on search engines.

**Conclusion**

You don’t have to spend countless hours on audio and video file transcriptions since automatic transcription software products offer a simple solution. What’s more, you won’t even have to go through the software installation process, as each of the automatic transcriptions software products we featured in this article can be used from a web browser.
