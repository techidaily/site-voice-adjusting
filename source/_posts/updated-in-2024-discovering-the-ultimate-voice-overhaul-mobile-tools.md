### Streaming Platforms

Many sites have enormous libraries for DJs to create DJ background music. But today, these are replaced by the most fantastic streaming services like Spotify and Apple music.

You can hunt for DJ songs on these, but you'll have to download the files from another service if you do not have a compatible DJ programme. But these days, even these platforms are finding their way into DJ software.

The easier and best way is to explore the playlists that already exist on these apps. This way, you can discover new songs for DJ's based on the listening trends of the audience.
