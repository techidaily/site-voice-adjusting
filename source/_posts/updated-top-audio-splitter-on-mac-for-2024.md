There are lots of programs made to split audio tracks. If you are looking for the best free apps for the Mac, then you are on the right page. Below are the top audio splitters for Mac users.

## Part 1\. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create.

### Step 2: Browsing the Media File

Browse the targeted video from your system. The video will be shown in the Media Library. Now, drag it to the timeline of the editor. The program displays a dialogue box regarding the frame rate of the media. You can either keep the project settings or match them to media settings.

### Step 3: Using the "Audio Denoise" Function

Moving on, right-click on the video located in the timeline. Click on "Show Properties" from the menus that appear. The properties would appear for video, audio, color, and animation. Head to "Audio" and enable the "Audio Denoise" feature.
