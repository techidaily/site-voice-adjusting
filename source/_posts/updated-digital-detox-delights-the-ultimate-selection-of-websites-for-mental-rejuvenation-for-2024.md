Alternatively, you can use the "timer" button to conduct a quick session without narration.

In addition to the music, the nature scenes depicted, such as misty riverside scenes and rays of sunlight streaming through clouds, add an extra touch. You can also download the Calm iPhone app for free but it will have limited features.

The name itself suggests that Calm can help you achieve your goals. There are two ways to get there: guided calm or timer. A session can last anywhere from two to twenty minutes. You will hear a voice guide you on how to relax tense muscles and the mind when you choose the guided calm option. Alternatively, you can use the "timer" button to conduct a quick session without narration.

In addition to the music, the nature scenes depicted, such as misty riverside scenes and rays of sunlight streaming through clouds, add an extra touch. You can also download the Calm iPhone app for free but it will have limited features.

![do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster.png)

Its title speaks for itself. There won't be any other activity for two minutes except listening to the waves. The purpose of this website is to test your ability to resist doing nothing. If you touch your keyboard or mouse, you will get a failure message, and the clock will reset again if you do. The majority of people fail several times before they complete the task. It is quite fun and challenging at the same time. While you focus on completing the challenge, you will forget all the worries on your mind.

Taking a quick break of 2 minutes can sometimes be all you need to reset your mind. It's also available as an app (for iOS).

You can play multiplayer piano online. In the end, everyone plays simultaneously, and it's crazy but fun. Both your mouse and keyboard can be used. Also available on the site are the possibilities of starting a chat with some random 'composers' or playing by yourself. If you don't want to play in multiplayer mode, you can switch to solo mode. You can also record the piano that you play and then listen to it. Overall this website is quite fun.
