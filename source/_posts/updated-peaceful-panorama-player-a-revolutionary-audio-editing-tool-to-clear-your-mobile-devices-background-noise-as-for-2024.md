Why Do You Need An Audio Mixer For Streaming?

If you've ever wondered why some people's audio sounds so much better than others when streaming, it's likely because they're using an audio mixer.

An audio mixer is a console that takes multiple audio signals and combines them into one signal. This allows you to control the individual levels of each sound, as well as add special effects like EQ and reverb.

While you don't necessarily need an audio mixer to stream, it can certainly make your life easier. So, if you're planning on doing any sort of professional streaming, this device is a must-have. However, they can be expensive, complicated to use, and sometimes add latency to your live audio.

Things from audio file can be copied, pasted, replaced, cut and deleted as per need and simple manipulation functions can be applied to do something interesting as a result. It can be applied to so many applications for example if we have to remove any undesired interference like cough, breaths, phone sounds from audio files or want to loop, slice or adjust various beats.
