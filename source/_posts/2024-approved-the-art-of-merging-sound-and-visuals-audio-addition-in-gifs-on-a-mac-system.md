**Step 3: Edit your text**

To edit your custom text, double-click the **Text** thumbnail on the timeline. Now on the text editor panel, customize your font, color, alignment, and size of your text. Or you can choose a built in text style from the text style library. Further, go to the **Animation** tab, to add special animations to your text.

Now you can either click **ok** to save the edits or choose the **Advanced** option to enter the advanced editing panel. Here you can customize the text with elements, shapes, text boxes, and shadows. You can also adjust the duration of your text as you like.

**CONCLUSION**

Converting audio to text is not anymore a menial task and does not require human transcribers sitting all day long to listen to audio files. The automatic online transcription apps and platforms allow anyone to **convert mp3 to text** extremely fast and efficiently. You can transcribe any audio file just like a native speaker with 99 percent accuracy without knowing much about the process.

This strategy can benefit students, professionals, and others who want to consume information but find it hard to concentrate or remember things.
