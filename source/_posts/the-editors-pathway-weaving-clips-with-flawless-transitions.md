And it's done! Now you can listen to the joined audio to make sure you like it. If it's so, download it to your device or back to cloud storage. Otherwise, just go back to editing.

## CONCLUSION

Merging audios is combining several audio files into one. We usually select the songs whose styles are similar with each other. Then, we can adjust the playback speed and combine them into a new one. Besides, we can mix two songs. For example, we can mix the narrator’s words into a song. By this way, listeners can understand the meaning while enjoying the songs.
