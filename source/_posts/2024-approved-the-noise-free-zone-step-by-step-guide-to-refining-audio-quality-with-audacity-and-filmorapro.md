For a [recording to have good audio quality](https://blogs.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/4-simple-tips-for-recording-high-quality-audio/), it needs to have as little background noise as possible. Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.

**Noise reduction** is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.

The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do **noise reduction in Audacity**.

## Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/) is a lightweight opensource audio recording and editing software that’s used by many serious podcasters and vloggers. It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE. You can know more infomation of Audacity from [PCmag review](https://www.pcmag.com/review/362572/audacity). This recording will provide a clear sample of the background noise in the room and will be very useful in the noise reduction process. See steps below:

* The first step is to create a NOISE PROFILE. This profile tells Audacity the nature of the noise to be reduced or eliminated from the audio recording. To create a NOISE PROFILE, open your ROOM TONE recording and click on EFFECT > NOISE REDUCTION.
* If you didn’t make a ROOM TONE recording, then open the audio file you want to process. Once opened, click and drag over a section that contains mostly noise to select it. Then, click on EFFECT > NOISE REDUCTION.

![audacity noise reduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audacity-noise-reduction.jpg)

* Once a new window labelled ‘STEP 1’ opens, click on the ‘GET NOISE PROFILE’ button. This creates the NOISE PROFILE which Audacity will use in the noise reduction process.

![apply audacity noise reduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/apply-noise-reduction.jpg)

* Next, select the entire audio file that requires noise reduction. Then, select NOISE REDUCTION from the EFFECTS tab on the top menu bar.
* When the new window labelled ‘STEP 2’ opens, take your time to enter the settings that give you the desired level of noise reduction. Carefully adjust the bands for NOISE REDUCTION, SENSITIVITY and FREQUENCY SMOOTHING.

![manually reduce noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/set-how-to-reduce-noise.jpg)

* Now, click the PREVIEW button to hear the effect of your noise reduction settings. If you are not satisfied with the preview, you can adjust the settings bars until you achieve a good result.
* You should also click on the RESIDUE radio button to hear the sounds that will be eliminated from your recording if your chosen settings are applied. This can be very useful as some settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. If you hear valuable audio content captured in the residue, adjust your settings accordingly. Try as much as possible to minimize the loss of valuable audio content.
* Once you are satisfied with your audio preview and residue, click the OK button with the REDUCE radio button selected. This will perform the noise reduction effect on your audio recording.

## Conclusion

Keep in mind that noise reduction is not a perfect process and strong noise reduction settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. Whether you choose to use Audacity or Filmora, try to strike the right balance between getting rid of background sounds and retaining valuable audio content.

## "Windows Users: Top 10 Essential Audio Leveling Tools "

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

Normalization is still a useful feature that helps to equalize volume in different files. Let us look at some of the best audio normalizers available in Windows.

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Wondershare Filmora is a widely used video editing application famous for its extensive video and audio editing features. The Auto Normalization in Filmora is an AI integrated feature that analyses the volume of all the clips you have selected. It then automatically adjusts the volumes to 23.0LUFS, the standard loudness level of European audio programs.

To enable Auto Normalization on Filmora:

Go to the timeline and double click on the audio clip you wish to normalize, and from the window that appears, go to Audio, select Audio Normalization, and tap OK.

The audio will be analyzed and normalized automatically within some time.

Open audacity, click on Effect from the top toolbar, and then select Normalize. Three different options will be given for you to apply.

You can remove the DC offset, independently normalize stereo channels or normalize the maximum amplitude to your desired decibel.

### 3\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

As you all might know Adobe premium pro is a wonderful video editing application used by beginners and professionals alike. To normalize audio on adobe premium pro, go to the timeline, right-click on the audio file, and tap on Audio Gain…

A small window will appear, from which you can select the Normalize Max Peak to: option. The dB can be manually adjusted to your desired limit.

Click OK after making the necessary adjustments, and the changes will take place instantly.

### 4\. [MP3Gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/)

MP3Gain is an audio normalizing tool that analyses and adjusts the volumes of mp3 files so that they all have the same volume. They also ensure the original quality after the sound normalization process.

After the installation of MP3 gain on your device open it. Select Options, then Filename Display, and then Show File Only. Then tap on Add File(s) and add the files you need to normalize to MP3Gain.

This application can be used to play several songs at the same volume and the need to adjust the volume at the beginning of each song can be avoided.

### 10\. [Movavi](https://www.movavi.com/)

Movavi is a video editor with a very intuitive interface and a big collection of effects. Normalizing the audio using Movavi is very simple, and to do so, open the application and import the file first to the timeline.

Double click on the file on the timeline and click on Clip Properties. From the General tab, tick mark the Normalize box, and the whole audio track will be normalized.

## What is the best audio normalizer for you?

An audio normalizer can be used for a variety of purposes. Some people use it to play songs without having to adjust the volume for each song manually, others use it for enhancing the volume of songs that has a very low volume, and some others use it for video editing purposes.

A list of applications with sound normalizers has been listed above, and you can choose any one of them depending on your purpose. Some of these apps, like Wondershare Filmora, Final Cut Pro X offers extensive audio editing features and audio normalization, which can be very helpful in video editing. If you wish to increase the volume of the files while playing, you can go with VLC, MP3Gain, etc. Hope our suggestion helps to provide you with a better audio experience.
