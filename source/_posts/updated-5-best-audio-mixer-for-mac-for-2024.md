Whеn your original rеcording is of high quality, it bеcomеs easier to distinguish between the foreground audio (such as vocals or dialoguе) and thе background music. High-quality audio provides a clean canvas for your edits, minimizing the risk of audio degradation during the removal process.

#### ● Adjust Noise Reduction Settings

Fine-tuning these settings can make a significant difference in the outcome. Here are few steps after uploading the audio file in Audacity;

* Step 1 - Choose a section of the track with background noise. Try to find an area of the track with only background noise and drag your mouse over it.

### Our Recommendations

Due to the advanced features and high scores on G2, we recommend using Audacity. However, other factors always come into play as the audio editing demands and needs change with time. So, **Sound Forge** can be a good option for you as a nomad in the music editing industry.

Most companies (with 50-200 employees and 1M-10M revenue) and the higher education industry in the United States are using Sound Forge.

On the other hand, businesses often use Audacity for marketing purposes, such as making Podcasts. The software can record audio for PowerPoint presentations to help visually impaired employees.

## Conclusion

In this article, we've introduced Sound Forge, its price, the software's features, and what the users think about it. Later in the guide, we compared Sound Forge with one of the leading music editors, Audacity, and learned how they stack up against each other.

Hopefully, you can now decide better about choosing a music editing software for your audio recording and editing needs.

## Part 4\. Pros and Cons of MAGIX Sound Forge

* **User-friendly:** The top-notch software comes with a user-friendly interface, making it easy to learn and simple to control for beginners in the audio editing field.
* **Compatibility:** The high-quality audio software solution is available for both Windows and Mac operating systems.
* **Customizable software:** Sound Forge is the most customizable software, offering customization of toolbars to get the exact tools you need and letting you change audio editing windows arrangement.
* **Support VST plugin:** Sound Forge supports the [VST plugin](https://www.lifewire.com/what-are-vst-plugins-4177517) that is used to integrate software audio effects and effect plugins to help you create a more compelling final product.

### Cons of Sound Forge

* **No Batch Processing:** one main drawback of Sound Forge is that it cannot do batch processing, making it useless to process multiple audio files and plug-ins together.
* **Noise reduction/ Noise cancellation:** The software does not do much for noise reduction; its "Noise Gate Technology" distort the recording instead of filtering the noise.

### What is Audacity?

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is free and open-source software developed by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger Dannenberg and released on May 28, 2000\. In April 2021, Muse group acquired the Audacity trademark but kept the application free and open source.
