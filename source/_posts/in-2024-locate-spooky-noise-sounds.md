## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![options showed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png)

**Step 6:** Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.

**Step 7:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-1.png)

### 2\. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself

**Step 2:** Press record and make the sound effect you want.

**Step 3:** End the recording by pressing stop recording. You will now have recorded a scary music sound effect saved on your computer.

This option is attractive to many people, from beginners to people testing out the waters of audio editing. However, it should be noticed that the sound quality is not the best.

You can get free sound effects from websites such as Freesound.com or Soundeffectsplus.com.

**Step 2:** Register an account

**Step 3:** Then search your desired sound effect

![search the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-7.png)

**Step 4:** Press download next to it.

Pretty straightforward, and as mentioned, these are free, but with limitations such as total download amount per month or licensing.

### 4\. Buying Sound Effects

If you have money but not time to make your audio effects, you can buy sound effects off the internet. Usually, these sellers have excellent quality audio; they can even make specific sound effects tailored to your needs.

* Many websites sell sound effects, including the likes of – <www.prosoundeffects.com> and <www.soundsnap.com>.

## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Final Verdict

Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.

## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Final Verdict

Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.

## Part 5: Audio editing - 5 tips for mixing audio

#### Keyframe audio Levels

After fixing the primary audio, you shift your task to the new audio that you are adding to the video. Preview your track and make adjustments, then add the music to timeline and start balancing everything that seems out of place by managing the keyframes. Either work with the clip keyframes, or with the entire track, do whatever seems more pleasing with the composition.

#### Use filters and effects

You can apply filters/effects as you require, and keep in mind that an audio should only be added for enhanced effects, when you have a clear source for that effect. They shouldn’t make the composition weird. Use appropriate filters that separate a voice-over and a telephonic voice from usual dialogue in a video/audio.

#### Volume is important

Editing video or audio clip is just like attending a live concert. If not paid attention, the surrounding music will overpower the vocalist, or the guitar might be too low to be audible due to the dominant bass effect. The volume should be properly tuned to match with the rest of the audio visuals while adding audio to video. You can pick portions of the audio and balance audio level accordingly to allow a drop in volume during vocals and rise when there are no vocals.

#### Change tempo

The change in tempo enhances the composition. You can get creative and experiment. Let’s say there is a portion in your video that is slow and has music at a regular pace. Then why not stretch the tempo and slow it down to blend properly with your video? Altering the tempo brings more creative aspects to create better audio visuals.

#### Use fade in and fade out

While adding audio to video, if the new one music is instrumental whereas the existing one in the video is a quiet background track, the sudden change in volume might sound weird. Effective use of fades can lower the aural unexpectedness of the instruments.

## Final Verdict

Coming towards the end of the discussion and after going through an elaborated list of video editing applications, we came to a final verdict that Filmora sound to be the best out of them. It allows you to flawlessly edit audio and video files on your desktop, with multiple in-built royalty free music tracks to choose from that can enhance your video’s beauty.
