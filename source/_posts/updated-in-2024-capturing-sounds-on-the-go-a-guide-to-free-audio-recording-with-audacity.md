**Step 3:** Now you have a screen captured video with sound included. Since we need th audio only, we can attache the [audio from the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) first and then do some editing such as adding fade in and fade out effect, or remove unwanted audio clip.

## Part 4: How to Set up Audacity to Record as Schedule?

A streaming video recorder or cassette can be used to arrange a recording. All of those are identical to Time Recordings in that they are used to schedule recording. The Timer record configuration dialog box may be used to set the beginning and finish of the recording. This is how you do it:

**Step 1:** By definition, the recording's **Start Date and Time** are set to the present time. It will begin recording on the present day and hour by default when you don't alter it. There is no default setting for the **End Date and Time**. You must either choose a date and time to determine the end time.

![audacity schedule recording ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-set-start-end-schedule.jpg)

**Step 2:** There is a **Checkbox** to **Save** the work immediately. By **Ticking** the option, you may choose the path or **Folder** where the file will be saved when the recording is finished.

Making music is something we are not all gifted with the ability to do. For those that are, the new digital age has introduced multiple new ways to record, edit, and eventually produce new tunes in the best possible level of quality.

Why Do You Need An Audio Mixer For Streaming?

If you've ever wondered why some people's audio sounds so much better than others when streaming, it's likely because they're using an audio mixer.

An audio mixer is a console that takes multiple audio signals and combines them into one signal. This allows you to control the individual levels of each sound, as well as add special effects like EQ and reverb.

While you don't necessarily need an audio mixer to stream, it can certainly make your life easier. So, if you're planning on doing any sort of professional streaming, this device is a must-have. However, they can be expensive, complicated to use, and sometimes add latency to your live audio.
