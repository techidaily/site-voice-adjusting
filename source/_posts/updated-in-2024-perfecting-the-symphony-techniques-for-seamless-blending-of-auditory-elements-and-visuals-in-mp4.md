## How to Convert AIFF to MP3

There are various ways to convert your AIFF files to MP3\. It depends on your preferences. You can choose from the different solutions available for you, which include free online conversion services, free desktop software programs, and all-purpose audio editors and converters that support converting AIFF to MP3 files.

## #1. Free Online Conversion Services
