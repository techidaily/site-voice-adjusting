### 1\.  How can I make my sound louder in Filmora?

It is a really easy method that you do not need to go into detailed study to learn how to make the sound louder.

Let us start:

* Open Filmora and import your audio.
* Drag the audio into the timeline in the audio layer.
* Now click on the audio in the timeline, and you will find a blue line inside this layer.
* Drag that blue line up and down, you will find when you go up the volume will become louder and when you drag the audio down the volume will be lower.

### 2\. How can I remove background noise from recordings in Filmora?

Here’s a method to remove the noise from the background of your audio.

Let us start;

* Right-click on the audio in the timeline.
* Go to the **Adjust audio** option. You will see a few audio settings here.

![noise1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/noise1.png)

* First of all, click on the **de-noise** feature to remove the background noise from the audio.

Usually, when you increase the volume of your audio the noise in the background will also increase so this feature is very important.

* Now click on the **auto normalization**, this will help to level up the volume of the audio.  
While making audio, we have different tones of the volume. Sometimes we speak loud with more energy and sometimes we have low volume and this auto normalization feature will help to adjust the level of the whole audio.  
In this latest version of Filmora, we have two more features that are **wind removal** and hum removal.
* Click on the **hum removal**, it removes the humming noise in the recorded audio.
* Click on the **wind removal**, it automatically removes the sound of the wind which will make your audio clear.
* Finally, press **Ok**.
