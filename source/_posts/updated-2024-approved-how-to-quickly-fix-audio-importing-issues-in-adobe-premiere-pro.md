## Four Ways to Solve Audio Importing Issues in Adobe Premiere Pro

There are numerous factors that can cause Adobe Premiere Pro to [stop functioning properly](https://forums.adobe.com/thread/2356540), and if the app won’t let you import video files into a project because it has no audio or video streams, there are few things you can do to fix this without having to reinstall the operating system on your computer or the version of Adobe Premiere Pro you’re currently using.

### [![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 1\. Clearing the Media File Cache

If you tried to import a video file into a project and the app notified you that it cannot import the file because there is no audio stream, you should head over to the **Edit menu** and select the **Preferences Tab.** Once the Preferences window pops up on the screen, click on the **Media tab** and then proceed to delete all files that are stored in the **Media Cache Database** and **Media Cache Files** folders. Restart the application after you’ve cleaned both of these folders and try to import the video clips into the project once more. If the issue persists, there are a few more things you can do.

![clear Media File Cache](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Clearing-Media-File-Cache-no-sound.jpg)

### 2\. Renaming the Media Cache Folder

The default location of Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files folders is **/Users/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common** on Mac computers and **\\Users\\\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\Common** on PC computers. So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to **Media Cache Files\_OLD** and **Media Cache\_OLD**. Start Adobe Premiere Pro and check if you can import your video files into the editor.

### 3\. Moving Media Files to a Different Folder

If renaming the folders didn’t do the trick you can try moving them from their default location. You can move them wherever you want on your computer, but it is best if you pick a location that is easy to remember, just so you can access them quickly in case you need to delete files that are stored in them.

### 4\. Installing the QuickTime Player

Sometimes the simplest solution is also the most effective one. Check if QuickTime is installed on your computer because installing this player can solve the audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro. Furthermore, if you just reinstalled the OS on your computer, you should [download and install QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/quicktime), before launching Adobe Premiere Pro. Once you create a new project go to the **Edit menu**, find the **Preferences submenu and select the Media option**. Clean both the **Media Cache Database and Media Cache Files** folders, restart Adobe Premiere Pro and then import the video files into your project.

## Achieving Sonic Excellence: Incorporating Auto-Tune Into Your Audacity Workflow

You might be surprised to learn that audacity's many default audio effects do not include an autotune feature if you have ever had to correct a song's pitch or tuning. Not to worry!. GSnap is a free plugin that lets you use autotune (not to be confused with Auto-Tune) in audacity. On Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux computers, you can autotune and adjust the pitch of recorded files using GSnap.

This article will guide you to download the audacity autotune plugin to your computer and install it. Then you will be able to adjust the pitch of your sounds easily and tune them automatically without any hassle. This is a free download that can be installed in audacity to help you fine-tune your live vocal performance. During vocal pitch correction, it allows audacity to expand its functionality.

## **How Does Auto-tune Works?**

Negative feedback from listeners is a common occurrence for singers. They need to satisfy their audience by giving them their most perfect production numbers. Nevertheless, there are instances when they need the aid of a device to conceal their mistakes or avoid making them. So they lip-sync and autotune their prerecorded songs.

Singers and music producers are not the only ones to use autotune. The most common users are ordinary people who have made music creation a part of their lives. Then how does autotuning operate?

The pitch is raised to the nearest correct tone when a person sings with the key off (out-of-tune). Moreover, the distortion can mask the out-of-tune parts (especially the highest and lowest pitches) in the overall performance.

## **How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?**

The autotune effect in audacity is enabled by the GSnap plugin (from GVST). This might be useful for correcting your pitch or creating a robotic voice. You can download it for free and install it on your computer.
