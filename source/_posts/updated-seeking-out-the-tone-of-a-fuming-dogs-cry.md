In the Zapslat site, you can find whoosh, swoosh, and swish sound effects whipped through the air to create the sound.

The whoosh sound effect is usually related to the speed as if something is being snatched or something passing quickly.

There are 110 sound effects created by using objects like bamboo cane, sticks, rods, cables, fishing ropes, and many more. You can listen and download the mp3 files for free, but the WAV files are only available to the gold members.
