## Conclusion

Thus, with a discussion over two different ways to implement the **audio ducking** feature, it's time to state our final overview. No doubt, the PowerDirector audio ducking feature offers the simplistic way, but it lacks flexibility. Due to the keyframe setting's automation, you can't check for a specific part in the audio and adjust the volume as per your needs. However, this could have been done pretty quickly in Wondershare Filmora's video editor, making it the best alternative to CyberLink PowerDirector. Keeping it the top priority, begin your journey today!
