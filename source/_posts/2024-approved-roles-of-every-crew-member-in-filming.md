## Roles of Every Crew Member in Filming

When shooting a small-scale video, only one person handles all department workings. He or she works not only as a director, but also a cinematographer and the camera operator.

However, as the production grows and needs large-scale filming, more specific members are needed for different departments. Whether you want to set up a filming studio, or join a movie-making workshop, you'd better figure out the entire composition of the film crew and choose the best one according to your capabilities.

To simplify the scenario, we have divided the crew into these major departments, as shown below, with their work areas.

## What Is the Role of a Producer?

The producer is the main handler of the filming. Before filming, he finds out the content and directions and links with the director and DP for each direction to get the best vision of the music video. The producer are responsible for:

### 1\. Schedule the crew members

Producers can make the call sheets for the crew members to maintain their schedule according to the specific timelines.

### 2\. Find the studio space

To find the studio space, the producers work with the directors to get the exact location according to the script of their music video for better illustrations.

### 3\. Find the gear

Producers found the gear for the studio space and handled the renting of the equipment from the warehouse.

### 4\. Build relationships with the industries

If the filming is starting and you don't know who to choose, you should build a relationship with the appropriate people in the industry. So that when you are in trouble, you can call them off to get the solution.

## Roles of a Director Department

The director is considered to be in charge of filmmaking. His main responsibility is creatively giving the idea to the production and communicating to the crew and characters to check out what they want in their scenes to play out.

The director department mainly consists of the director and the first assistant director, and sometimes there is a 2nd, a 3rd, and 4th AD. For example,

### 1st AD

The first lead is mainly in charge of time management, communicate with the crew member, and ensuring that the shorts get done safely and readily.

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** If there is no dialogue in the shorts, then the director usually gives reference pictures of the scenes and moods to act in that way.

You need to work with different people in the industry to check their personalities and work according to them. There is no need to work with the same people repeatedly.

## Team for Production Designing

The next and foremost department is the production design. In this the production designer is the leader of all and has to work with the art director. He is mainly in charge of the set builders, set dressers, prop makers, hair and makeup, and costume and wardrobe departments.

In this department, the production designer is mainly involved in decorating the sets, making props, and setting up the lighting.

![working of production designing team](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/working-of-production-designing-team.gif)

**Cinematographers Department**

The cinematic department comes to the frontline to give the shots and the lit music video final touches. In this, the head of the department is also known as the director of photography.

### Director of photography

## Director's monitor

The director's monitor is the screen that displays a live shoot and filming of everything happening on camera. It mainly gives each take's exact position and views for coordinating with the director and the DP.

Due to this, they can change the direction and the setup wherever they want and whenever they want.

![director monitor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/director-monitor.gif)

### Camera operators

To operate the camera, the DPs are not involved, but there is a specific job of the camera operators, which handle the shots and moves according to the director's directions. There are also 1st and 2nd Assistant Cameras (AC) with the camera operators.

**1st Assistant Camera**

The duty of the 1st AC is to focus on the required target, pulling, swapping the lenses from the camera. He is ensuring that the camera is all set and workable on the shoot day without any trouble.

**2nd Assistant Camera**

The 2nd AC has to consider the slates of the shots, place exact locations and markers for the characters, and give exposed footage to save for the backup.

### Gaffers and key grip

Gaffers and key grip have their own teams for maintaining the lighting and grip work assigned by the DP according to the creative plans.

### Digital media technician

DMT will handle the exposed footage, which Digital Memory Card will do with tapes denoting the card's number. Make sure to make two backups of the footage to prevent any trouble.

![digital memory card](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/digital-memory-card.jpg)

![note](https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png)

**Note:** Making two copies for the backup will reduce the risk of corrupted files and physical accidents of losing the footage.

## Additional Roles

If you are the music video **director**, you need a **Cinematographer** with **Camera Operators**. He will be in charge of pulling and adjusting all the camera alignments. If you have enough budget, go with the **co-producer** to help you direct the talents.

![additional roles of director department](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/additional-roles-of-director-department.jpg)

To make your subject looks good and modern according to the theme, you should hire **hair and makeup artist.** If you have more budget, you can do it professionally with more and more crew members.

## Conclusion

If you are a starter, then there is no need to worry to pull-off all the roles in a crew; you just need two to three people for the start-up. That's all about the large production, but whenever you scale up, you should know how to manage all the members with their required areas.

## "Most Popular Websites Offering Montage Audio Archives"

In music, montage is a technique whereby newly branded compositions or sound objects, such as songs, are created from montage or collage. We will give you all the information you need to know before going for a montage music download. We will also highlight where you can get music tracks to add to your montage video.

## Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music

Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:

#### 1\. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device

Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.

If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.

#### 2\. The Safety of Your Device

When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.

Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.

Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.

#### 3\. Internet Connectivity

You'll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.

If you download montage music using a phone contract, there's a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.

If you've got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.

#### 4\. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music

When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.

Before you download any montage music online, read the download site's terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.

#### 5\. The Quality of the Montage Music File

Some montage music files you'll find online are of low quality. And this can affect your audience's listening experience. Before you get any downloadable montage music, check its quality.
