The recordings of important business meetings or stunning moments from the events you attended contain both sound and video. Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free. That’s why, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online tools that allow you to separate audio from video files in just a few easy steps.

## Top 6 Online Audio Extractors

The limitations in terms of size and file format can narrow down your choices of online audio extractors. So, before you decide which platform you are going to use, you must first check the size and file format of your video. Let’s take a look at some of the best online audio extractors you can use to create high-quality audio files for free.

#### 2. [Online Audio Converter](https://online-audio-converter.com/)

The wide range of supported file formats, as well as the straightforward audio extraction process, make this platform one the best choices for anyone who wants to create an audio file from a video. The maximum size of the video file you can upload to Online Audio Converter is **2048mb**, which means that you can even convert high-resolution files that last more than just a few minutes. Once you’ve uploaded a video file from your computer, **Google Drive, Dropbox** or some other online destination, you just have to select the **output format** and **the quality** of the audio file. Optionally, you can click on **the Advanced settings option** if you would like to add **fade in and fade out effects**, try to **remove voice** or change the **bitrates and sample rates**. Click on the **Convert button** when ready and proceed to **save the file** to your computer or at some online destination.

#### 3. [AudioExtracter](https://audio-extractor.net/)

This platform enables you to convert video files to audio files **automatically**, but it also offers a variety of **video, photo and audio editing tools** you can use free of charge. You just have to upload a file, in **MP4, AVI** or any other commonly used video file formats, that is smaller than **500mb** and AudioExtracter will convert your video into an MP3 audio file you can save to your computer. The only downside is that you can’t choose an **output format, readjust the bitrate and select the quality of the audio file** you are creating, which can significantly restrict your options. The platform also offers a new feature that enables you to **convert YouTube videos into MP3 files,** so that you can save all your favorite songs as audio files on your computer.

#### 4. [Online Video Converter](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/convert-mp4-to-mp3)

Online Video Converter supports almost all video file formats, which means that you can extract audio files from virtually any video clip, but keep in mind that the maximum size of the file you’d like to convert can’t exceed the **1000mb limit**. The audio extraction process is rather simple as you just have to **upload the file** and wait for the platform to prepare your file for conversion. Afterward, you just have to **select the output format** and click on the **Start button** and once the conversion process is completed, you can save the file to a destination on your device or use the **QR code** to download it to a **Smartphone or tablet**. What’s more, you can also use the **Online Video Converter** to extract audio files from [YouTube videos](https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter).

Click on the **Start button** to commence the extraction process and use one of the available methods to download the file.

#### 5. [Video2Mp3](https://video2mp3.net/en/)

YouTubers who already have channels on the world’s largest video sharing platform can use the Video2Mp3 tool to turn their videos into MP3 files effortlessly. You don’t even have to be a registered YouTube user to convert videos stored on this platform with Video2Mp3, because you can just pick any video that is uploaded to YouTube and turn it into an MP3 file with this powerful audio extraction tool. Once you’ve pasted the video’s **URL into the platform’s URL box**, simply click on the Convert to MP3 button. You will then have to specify the preferred **output format**, or use the platform’s **Search and Convert** option that lets you search for videos on **Dailymotion, Clipfish or YouTube** and convert them. Click on the **Convert button** to initiate the conversion process, **insert the name of the artist and title** of the song you’re converting and proceed to download the video.

#### 6. [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/)

You can convert a video file with Zamzar in just three quick steps, upload a file from an online destination or from your device, **pick the output format** and click on the Convert button.
