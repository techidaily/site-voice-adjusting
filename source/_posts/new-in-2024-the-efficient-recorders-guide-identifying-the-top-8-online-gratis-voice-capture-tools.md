## "The Soundtrack for Aspiring Reporters: A 15 Piece Selection of News-Centric Melodies"

Visuals are important when communicating breaking news to the audience. Right? However, sound plays an equally crucial role. Allow me to elaborate!

A news background music engages the audience. It keeps viewers in the loop and compels them to know the next big story. Without the intense music in the news, the dramatic effect wouldn't be established. Don't you agree?
