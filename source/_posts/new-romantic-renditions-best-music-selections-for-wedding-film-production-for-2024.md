## Part 4\. Solution to Fix Clownfish Voice Changer Not Working

While using Clownfish Voice Changer, you might also come across some troubles. They might be because either the voice changer is not updated, or maybe the apps you are using are not up to date. Let us share some fixes with you for smooth Clownfish functioning.

### Fix 1: Update Clownfish Voice Changer

The most significant reason why you face trouble is that your Clownfish version is outdated. For this, you should update the voice changer to its latest version by following the steps given below:

Step 1: You have to start by opening the ‘Control Panel’ from the ‘Run’ window. For that, press ‘Windows and R’ together and then type ‘Control’ and press 'Enter.' Now, look for the 'Programs' section, and under that section, click on the 'Uninstall a Program.'

### Fix 2: Check the Application’s Version

Another reason that might be causing the problem is an incompatible version of the application with Clownfish. Both the voice changer and the application must have compatible versions. You can take assistance from the steps below to check the version of Skype.

Step 1: Start by opening Skype, and then from the left menu pane, click on your Skype profile. Then, from the quick access menu list, look for the ‘Settings’ option.

![open skype settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-15.jpg)

Step 2: After the ‘Settings’ window opens, click on the 'Help & Feedback’ option once located from the left pane. As the Help & Feedback screen opens, you will see the Skype logo on the screen, and under the logo, you will see the version of Skype.

![confirm skype version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-16.jpg)
