**Step4:** Once you have done adjusting the pitch of your voice, click ok to apply changes to your audio.

**Step5:** Now play the audio, and you will notice a considerable change in your voice. Even if you show the video to your friends and family, they won't even recognize your voice.

### **2\. Using Equilizer Option**

**Step1**: First of all, repeat all steps that we did in option one and open the audio settings of your video clip.

![equilizer-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/equilizer-step1.png)

**Step2:** Not go to the equalizer option and click on the arrow in front of the equalizer option.

![equilizer-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/equilizer-step2.png)

**Step3:** A dropdown menu will appear on your screen where you will see a lot of presets.

![equilizer-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/equilizer-step3.png)

**Step4:** You can select any preset of your choice from this menu. Like if you want to make your voice sound very crisp, then you can choose Sparkle preset.

**Step5:** Once you have selected your desired preset, click the ok button to apply it to your video.

**Step6:** Now listen to your video's audio, and you will notice a considerable difference in the voice of your video.

Also, don't forget to tick that auto normalization box at the bottom of the audio settings for the above-mentioned methods. It will automatically normalize your video's audio and make it sound more professional.

### **3\. Using Filmora Audio Effects**

The third method you can use to change your voice in a video is through the audio effects of Filmora.

**Step1:** Click on the Effects tab from the top menu, and you will see an audio effects option in the left sidebar.

![audio-effects-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-effects-step1.png)

**Step2:** You can see there are a lot of audio effects available to use in your videos.

**Step3:** If you want to apply any effect on your audio, drag the effect and drop it above your video in the timeline. A yellow symbol will appear on the video file, indicating that the effect has been applied to your audio.

**Step4:** Now play the video, and you will see that the audio effect has been applied to your voice, and it sounds a lot different.

---

Also, it has a very intuitive interface that is easy to adopt for anyone, even if you are a newbie and don't have any prior video editing experience. So, make sure to give it a try.
