To prevent language barriers, you can also use a language filter. A user is never matched up with someone they've already met through a special filter, ensuring each match is different. The ChatHub interfaces are excellent for both video chats and text chats. Since you don't need a profile, you can try without risk.

Additionally, ChatHub is concerned with the safety of its users. Conversations are kept private using peer-to-peer connections. You do not have to enter any personal information on this site.

**Features:**

      * No Registration Required
      * Language Filter To Prevent Language Barrier
      * You can choose to match with a unique stranger every time
      * The connection is private for additional security
