It is also designed to protect the audio file from becoming corrupt or invalid during the splitting process.

MP3TrueEdit is more than just an audio splitter Mac software. It is an audio editing tool that allows you to edit audio files. It can also be used to record meetings, talks or lectures so that you don’t have to miss a word. You can also record band practice sessions or choir rehearsals. Then you can edit the tempo or pitch of the recording to suit your needs.

### 4\. [MP3 Trimmer (Mac)](http://www.deepniner.net/mp3trimmer/)

MP3 Trimmer (Mac) is a quite easy to use audio splitter Mac tool. Not only does it allow you to split MP3 files, it can also be used to edit, join, repair, analyze audio files, and a lot more. There’s no need to re-encode and convert file formats with the use of various applications. All you need is the MP3 Trimmer if you want to remove portions of your MP3 files without losing the quality.

With the MP3 Trimmer, you will be able to remove the undesired portion of the audio file, add some fade-in/fade-out effects, change gain and add silence. If you have a couple of large audio files that needs to be split, then you can benefit from the batch-edit feature of the MP3 Trimmer. It also has built-in tools that will help you analyze and repair broken audio files. It is free to use as long as you want.

### 5\. [AudioSlicer for Mac](http://audioslicer.sourceforge.net/)

AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI app for Mac OS X. It's designed to find all the silences in an MP3 file. It also allows you to split the audio file and tag them properly. While there are other audio splitter Mac apps that can do the tasks automatically according to specific criteria, AudioSlicer displays the silences within the specified duration. It allows you to listen to the audio before and after the silence. Then you can decide if you want to do the split at that point. Splitting of the file is done without any loss to the quality because there is no decoding or re-encoding of the audio file during the process. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 and above and supports both Intel Macs and PowerPC.

That's the best audio trimming software for Mac. The most recommended is Wondershare Filmora for Mac. If you have other good choices, welcome to share with us.
