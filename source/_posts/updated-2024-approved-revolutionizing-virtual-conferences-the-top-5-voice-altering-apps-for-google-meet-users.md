## Part 2: What is MP3/MP4?

MP3 is short for MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts Group) Layer 3, an audio file format for storing digital audio data on a computer system. There are three types of audio file format:

* Uncompressed audio format: such as WAV, AIFF, AU etc.
* Lossless compressed audio format: .ape, .m4a etc.
* Lossy compressed audio format: MP3

Here is a comparision table. it is helpful to understand MP3 to MP4.

| File extension | Format | Handles              | Standards                  | Portability                      |               |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| MP3            | .mp3   | audio                | audio                      | ISO/IEC 11172-3, ISO/IEC 13818-3 | almost all    |
| MP4            | .mp4   | multimedia container | audio, video, text, images | ISO/IEC 14496-14                 | iPods/iPhones |

MP3 files are compressed to approximately 1/10 the original size of the music file without a corresponding decrease in fidelity and perceived audio quality.

Converting MP3 to any other music formats is also possible by using appropriate conversion software programs, so it it easy to conver MP3 to MP4 with a right converter.  
  
MP4 and MP3 sure sound familiar and it's possible that some may think that MP4 might be the next step for MP3\. However that’s not the case.

## Part 2: What is MP3/MP4?

MP3 is short for MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts Group) Layer 3, an audio file format for storing digital audio data on a computer system. There are three types of audio file format:

* Uncompressed audio format: such as WAV, AIFF, AU etc.
* Lossless compressed audio format: .ape, .m4a etc.
* Lossy compressed audio format: MP3

Here is a comparision table. it is helpful to understand MP3 to MP4.

| File extension | Format | Handles              | Standards                  | Portability                      |               |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| MP3            | .mp3   | audio                | audio                      | ISO/IEC 11172-3, ISO/IEC 13818-3 | almost all    |
| MP4            | .mp4   | multimedia container | audio, video, text, images | ISO/IEC 14496-14                 | iPods/iPhones |

MP3 files are compressed to approximately 1/10 the original size of the music file without a corresponding decrease in fidelity and perceived audio quality. Therefore it’s rather small in size, making it very easy to download, transfer and share. Converting MP3 to any other music formats is also possible by using appropriate conversion software programs, so it it easy to conver MP3 to MP4 with a right converter.  
  
MP4 and MP3 sure sound familiar and it's possible that some may think that MP4 might be the next step for MP3\. However that’s not the case. Indeed they are quite different in that MP4, which is short for MPEG-4, is a multimedia container format, used to store audio, and/or video data, as well as other data such as subtitles as well as images etc.
  
The biggest difference between them is that MP3 can only store audio, whereas MP4 can store multiple formats of multimedia files.
