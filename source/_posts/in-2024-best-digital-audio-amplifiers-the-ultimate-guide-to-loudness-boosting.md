### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.

### 3\. [Cyberlink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/)

**Price:** $99,99

**Compatibility:** Windows

Cyberlink PowerDirector lets you detect beats and generate markers both automatically and manually, which enables you to choose the method that is best suited for the project you are working on. After you add an audio file to the app’s timeline, you should right-click on it and chose the Use Automatic Music Beat Detection option.

You can then set the minimum amount of time between two beat markers and click on the Detect button if you want to add markers automatically. Optionally you can also add markers during playback manually by clicking on the Add button or using the A keyboard shortcut. When done you should click on the Apply button in the Automatic Music Beat Detection dialogue box and beat markers are going to be added to the timeline automatically. Nonetheless, you must edit all video clips you want to add to your project manually.

### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created. The process of editing a video to the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical since you have to add all the markers to a sequence manually, set In and Out points for each clip you would like to add to the timeline, and automate that sequence so that the app can place your footage on the timeline in the order you selected. The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.

### 5\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

![FCPX - sync video to the beat of a song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download-app.jpg)

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song. For more studio-problem, please see this article: **[Practical Guide on How to Sync Audio and Video in Final Cut Pro X 2021](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).**

### 6\. [Splice](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 11.0 or later

In case you are recording a lot of videos with your iPhone or iPad, then Splice is one of the best video editing apps you can install on your device. Besides a versatile set of video editing tools that enable you to cut video clips or apply filters to them, the app also syncs videos to the beat of a song automatically and it adds transitions at the cuts to ensure a smoother flow of a video. Splice is also equipped with a huge library of royalty-free music and a built-in voice recorder which enables you to sync your videos to different genres of music or even to your own voice. The free version of the app, however, offers only limited options and you must opt for a monthly or annual subscription model in order to gain access to all of Splice’s features.

### 7.Quik – GoPro Video Editor

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later, Android 5.0 and up

### 8\. [Beat Sync Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beat-sync-maker/id1434787464)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 11.0 or later

Roland Corporation has manufactured some of the most iconic instruments in the history of electronic music, so it is no wonder that their Beat Sync Maker is one of the best apps DJs can use to create VJ-ing for their performances.

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created. The process of editing a video to the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical since you have to add all the markers to a sequence manually, set In and Out points for each clip you would like to add to the timeline, and automate that sequence so that the app can place your footage on the timeline in the order you selected. The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.

**Price:** $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song.

**Conclusion**

Sound and music are often overlooked during the video editing process, which often reduces the quality of a video. A simple video editing technique like syncing the cuts with beats of a song can help you create dynamic videos that gather thousands of views, shares, and likes on social media. However, having the right sync video to music beat app is essential if you want to create professional-looking videos. Which app are you going to use to sync videos to the beats of a song?
