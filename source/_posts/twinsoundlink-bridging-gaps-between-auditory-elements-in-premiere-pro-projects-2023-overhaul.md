## Audacity for Podcasts Recording Tutorial

Audacity recording is simple after you've set up all of the settings you need. Make sure to pick just one (Mono) Recording Channel while you're recording with a single microphone.

Each microphone is assigned a separate audio channel if you have numerous microphones connected to an audio interface or mixer. There must be a separate microphone and channel for each participant on your podcast so that you can edit them separately and make sure they all sound well together.

Each of these mono channels will be blended into stereo when you export your podcast later.

There is nothing complicated about the actual recording procedure.

* To begin recording your podcast, press the red Record button.

* When you've finished recording your podcast, press the black Stop button.

![recording-tutorial2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-tutorial2.png)

* Once you've finished recording, use Ctrl+S to save the project. If Audacity crashes or you shut it by mistake, you won't be able to recover your edited audio file.

## Using Audacity to Edit Your Podcast

Audacity for Podcasts not only allows you to record your podcast, but it also allows you to edit it afterward. It is possible to send your raw podcast to the internet as soon as you complete the recording, but editing may add a degree of polish that makes it more pleasurable for the listener.

You may use Audacity to re-arrange your podcast's flow by cutting and relocating portions, reducing clipping, and even deleting background noise if one of your mics was too near or someone was talking too loudly. Audacity can even alter the levels of individual recordings.

Some of these editing chores are more difficult than others, but if you just have high-quality equipment & have your settings ideal, the podcast may not need a lot of effort. Check over a few different portions of your podcast to get a sense of how much work has to be done on it before publishing.

In Audacity, you may add music, clips, & sound effects to your podcast intro and outro.

## In Audacity, add music, clips, & sound effects for the podcast intro and outro

In Audacity, you may add & move sound clips, such as intro music.

* Click File > Import > Audio or press Ctrl+Shift+I to import your podcast audio into Audacity.

![audacity-export-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-export-step1.png)

* Make your choice of music for the opening, outro, or anything else you'd want to include.

![audacity-export-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-export-step2.png)

* It is possible to go back and forth between the past and future by clicking on the top toolbar's time shift function.

![audacity-export-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-export-step3.png)

* When your opening music stops, click and drag the main podcast audio track so that it begins when the music ends.

![audacity-export-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-export-step4.png)

* Add an outro or other sound effects & music that play throughout your podcast by following these similar instructions. There should be a separate channel for each sound file so that they may be easily moved across devices.
* Using the time shift tool, you may relocate an outro to the conclusion of your podcast if necessary. If you wish to add sound effects or music to your podcast, use the time shift tool to move them around.
* To test whether your audio tracks are positioned appropriately, just click the green Play button at any moment. The cursor icon in the toolbar may be used to start listening to a podcast at a different place in the track.

## In Audacity, here's how to export your podcast

After you've finished editing your podcast, listen to it one more time to ensure you're satisfied with the outcome, then save it to ensure you don't lose your work if anything goes wrong during the export process. When you export your podcast, you're creating an audio file that you can publish to your podcast host and share with others.

Here's how to export the Audacity podcast:

* Select File > Export > Export as... from the File menu.
* After giving your podcast a name, click Save.
* If you wish to add metadata, you may do so now, or just hit OK to begin the exporting process.
* This procedure may take a long time if the podcast is lengthy or your machine is sluggish. During this procedure, keep your computer turned on & prevent it from sleeping and hibernating.
* You're ready to publish your podcast to the podcast host once it's finished exporting.

## Conclusions

For recording, editing, & mixing your own podcast, an Audacity is a great option. And, like many podcasters, you could discover it meets your long-term requirements. With regard to voice effects, we talk about how people may use Filmora to modify and improve their voices. Filmora has the ability to re-speak video and audio, as well as previously recorded voiceovers. Video, audio, and voiceover files may all benefit from the Timeline's Pitch feature. Change the tonality of a video or recording to give it a unique sound. It's easy to replace the voices in the videos using Filmora. A video or narrative should accompany your viral in order for it to be effective. Changing Pitch allows you to alter the pitch of your voice. You may modify the pace of the video to alter the voice (Optional). Make a backup copy of the altered media.
