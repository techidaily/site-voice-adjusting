## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

![Music Visualizer APP  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trance-5d-music-visualizer-live-wallpaper.jpg)

#### 7. [Beatfind](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beat.light&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android

**User Rating:** 4.7

Have you ever heard a song you really like, but you had no way to find out its title or the name of the artist? The Beatfind app is just like [Shazam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shazam/id284993459?mt=8) music recognition app, but with audio visualization options, as it enables you to discover new music just moments after you hear it for the first time. The music recognition mode that uses the ACR Cloud technology identifies the song if the app is active and near a speaker. The app’s music visualizer relies on your phone’s microphone to gather sound data and synchronize the visuals with the audio input. However, Beatfind doesn’t provide the tools that allow you to customize or record your music visualizations.

#### 8. [Trapp – Music Visualizer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trapp-music-visualizer/id1447118917)

**Price:** Free, but the app offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

**User Rating:** 4.2

This is a perfect option for all iPhone users who want to have almost total control over the process of visualizing their music. The best part is that the Trapp app lets its users play their creations while they are using the iPhone’s native Music app. You can change the background colors, create custom particles by adjusting their shape, size, and color or play around with the Bass Effect in order to create stunning audio visualizations. The free version of the app provides only limited functionalities and you must choose a monthly or an annual subscription plan in order to use all of the app’s features.

#### 9. ProjectM – Music Visualizer

**Price:** Free, but contains ads on Google Play Store, $2.99 on the App Store

**Compatibility:**[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.psperl.prjM) ,[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/projectm-music-visualizer-and-media-player/id530922227?mt=8)

**User Rating:** 4.1

The iOS and Android versions of the ProjectM app have one major difference. The iOS version of the app contains a built-in media player, while the Android version doesn’t come with a media player. Nonetheless, both versions of the app offer powerful audio visualization features that enable you to create visuals from music in a wide variety of styles. ProjectM is probably one of the best music visualization apps for Android and iOS oprating systems as it contains hundreds of visual effects, multi-touch interactive visuals, and it provides Chromecast support. There are also several different modes available such as the Immersive Mode for KitKat devices or Live Wallpaper mode that creates animated wallpapers for your Smartphone.
