## "The Essential List of Non-Copyrighted Music Sets Ideal for Visionary Video Editors"

The popularity of montages is increasing every day, as they allow you to use fewer words and express more. Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer's attention and communicate your message. We'll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.

## What Is Copyright?

If you are wondering: What is copyright? It's a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.

Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.

If you're caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you'll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone's intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.

Claiming you didn't know about the artist's copyrighted material doesn't excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.

If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist's consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.

The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.

For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.

* [**Part 3: Best Apps for iPhone Music Recognition**](#part3)
* [**Part 4: How to Choose a Music Recognition App?**](#part4)

## How to Use the In-built Music Recognition on iPhone?

In November 2020, Apple released the iOS 14.2 update for their iPads and iPhones. One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.

You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.

Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:

Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -> General -> About, and then you will see the software version.

Step 1 - Open Settings> Control Center, and then tap **More** to scroll down.

Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center

![add music recognition feature to control center](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-recognition-to-control-center-ios.jpg)

It is very easy to access and use this music recognition feature. If you have an iPhone that uses facial ID recognition to unlock, then pull down the Control Center shade by swiping down from the top right corner of the phone and tap the music recognition button.

![using  music recognition feature in iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/using-music-recognition-to-identify-song.jpg)

If your iPhone has a home button, then swipe up to get into the Control Center menu and tap the music recognition button.

You will see the Music Recognition notification icon that shows which song is playing.

The iPhone will listen for around 10 to 15 seconds once you tap the button – and will attempt to identify the song in that time period.

This feature can recognize songs playing in your environment even when your headphones are plugged in.

YouTuber Ricardo Gardener has made a video showing how to use the iPhone Music Recognition feature step by step as well, enjoy!

## How to Use Siri to Identify Songs by Humming on iPhone?

You can also identify a song on your iPhone by using its virtual assistant, Siri. Siri can recognize a song playing in your environment and even the song you are humming. This how you do it:

Step 1- Activate Siri. You can do it two ways; the first is by long-pressing the home button or Wake/Sleep button in iPhone X and the second is by the voice command “Hey Siri”.

Step 2- Then say, “Hey Siri, which song is this”. This starts Siri’s listening mode.

Step 3 - Hum the tune that you want to be identified and Siri will return with results after a few seconds.

Mike has shown us how he uses Siri to identify the song playing on iPhone, let's have a look!

## Best Apps for iPhone Music Recognition

If your iPhone or iPad is not yet upgraded to iOS version 14.2 then you would have to use third part apps to identify songs. Following are the two best iPhone music recognition apps that you can use:

### 1\.  SoundHound

SoundHound is one of the best iPhone music recognition app out there. It has some of the most useful features regards to song recognition that helps you get a complete music experience.

The standout feature of SoundHound is that you can have a song recognized in it by merely humming a short tune. This is very helpful when you don’t remember the lyrics of the song or the song’s title or who sang it.

The service is pretty quick meaning you can have songs and music identified in a matter of seconds. You will get all available details of the concerned song or tune and what more, you can also sing along to real-time lyrics in the app.

It also allows you to stream your playlists from other music apps like Spotify, YouTube and others. Your song search list is stored so that you don’t have to look for a song all over again if you have once searched it on SoundHound. This saves time and keeps your discovered songs organized.

You can use the app for The paid service of Shazam goes by the name of Shazam Encore and it costs $2.99.

### 2\.  Shazam

Shazam is the most popular music recognition app available out there, and its features will tell you why. To begin with, it does the basic task of any music recognition service with near 100% accuracy.

It draws up all available information of a song you want identifying, from its huge database in a short time. There is also a lyrics feature that displays lyrics in sync with the song being played so you can sing along with it.

But these are regular features that you can find in any music recognition app. What gives Shazam an edge over other apps is the following additional features: offline usage and Pop-Up Shazam. You can use Shazam offline. It records the song offline, and later when you go online, it provides all the information about that song.

The Pop-Up Shazam is a unique feature that helps you identify any song that is played in your smartphone. It works with any app and is especially helpful when you are surfing social media and want to know about a song or background music you just came across on it.

There is also an Auto Shazam feature that works like “Now Playing” on Pixel devices. This feature works in the background and gives you song info notifications as it recognizes songs in your environment. The only drawback of this feature is that it doesn’t work offline.

Shazam is a free iPhone music recognition app.

## How to Choose a Music Recognition App?

Version 14.2 has made it easy to recognize songs on your iDevices. But those who do not have it need a third-party app to do that job. You need to look for a good iPhone song recognition app, one that does the job to your satisfaction.

There are hundreds of such apps available on the Apple App Store, and you need to sift through them to get the best one. Following are the features you should consider while choosing the most appropriate app:

* **Speed**

Most of the time, you come across unknown songs in noisy surroundings. It can be at a party or the supermarket. Your song recording can be interrupted by some loud noise like joyous shouts or announcements in both scenarios. Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.

Ideally, the app should recognize the song within a span of 5 to 10 seconds of launching.

* **Tenacity**

As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.

The Trial and error method is the best way to determine which app does the best job in this case. Test the apps in a noisy environment before you decide which you will ultimately use.

* **Accuracy**

Identifying a song title, the artists, the album it belongs to with nearly 100% accuracy is a must for any music recognition app. Besides that basic info, it must give accurate allied information like music videos, covers and trivia regarding the singer and the song.

Don’t bother yourself with an app that doesn’t recognize at least 8 of 10 songs it hears.

## FAQs About Recognizing Songs on iPhone

1. **Should I install Shazam app on iPhone to recognize songs?**

It depends on what version of iOS you are running. If the version is 14.2 and above, you don’t need to install Shazam separately as it comes integrated with your iPhone software. The in-built music recognition feature of the iPhone uses the Shazam database, and it recognizes songs and tunes the way the Shazam app does.

If you are running an older version, you need to install Shazam separately if you want to use it.

1. **What’s the difference between the Shazam app and the in-built Shazam music recognition feature?**

iOS users who haven’t upgraded to the iOS 14.2 update will not be able to access the features

When the process is complete, you’ll see a “Music Recognition” notification banner showing you what song is playing. This notification appears along with all your other apps’ notifications in your notification center.

Your iPhone will only listen for 10 to 15 seconds after you tap the button. If it can’t identify a song in that period of time, you’ll see a notification saying a song wasn’t detected.

### 1\. How do I mute a video in an editor?

You may mute a video by uploading it or importing it from a website like YouTube. Make sure your video has audio since turning the volume down won't do anything if it doesn't. Use the context menu to choose Mute after right-clicking on the video clip. The audio on the video clip will delete due to this action, but the audio will remain for that particular clip.

### 2\. How do you edit sound on TikTok?

If you choose the scissors symbol with your finger, you'll see a waveform emerge at the bottom of the screen. You may go to the song segment you wish to hear using your finger. From that location, you can see the song's time stamps. You may also control the volume of the sound by using the option "Volume," located at the very bottom of the screen.

### 3\. How do I repair a video muted on TikTok?

In case TikTok muted your video for any reason, you try these two options:

1. Delete the video, reupload it to TikTok, and then add sound to it while editing it so the video may get played. After that, reduce the sound level until it reaches zero, and you will be able to submit the video. You can include any sound in the video.
2. Ensure you do not reupload the exact video. You can use an external video editing tool like Filmora to add effects and cut the video into shorter clips. Once done, try reuploading the video and follow the TikTok guidelines this time.

Adding a sound to your video and lowering the level of that sound to zero is one way to prevent your video from being removed for violating copyright laws.

## Conclusion

Thus, this tutorial covered **how to mute your TikTok audio** before and after you publish a video. You can instantly alter the level of the music already on the device or any additional sounds by using the built-in Sound function. Besides, we also listed the best tool, Filmora, via which you can generate silent movies for the social platform. In short, if a sound isn't available on TikTok, you can get past TikTok's limited library by producing your film using an additional editing tool like Filmora. This program also guides you on **how to mute original audio in TikTok**. It will help if you either get stuck composing your music or use the already available sounds on TikTok.
