## Leading Free Audio Volume Harmonizer Platforms

What is Audio Normalization, what are its different types, why do we need it and how to do it online? – these are the questions we might ask when first learning about it. Well, then, let’s answer all of them!

Audio Normalization means that the loudest parts of an audio signal are set to a specific value. For example, -18 dBFS (decibels relative to full scale). This is done so that all the parts of the sound mix remain at equal volume levels.

You can use this tool when mixing or editing your music, or during playback on your speakers. In the case of mixing, listen for any clipping (A form of waveform distortion - It sounds like the audio is starting to 'break up,' which is light distortion. The more severe it is, the more distorted the music begins to sound) that could occur in your mix. So, in this case, you need to normalize before it becomes too loud and needs more and more fixing. So, normalizing the audio kind of means balancing the volume of the track.

Mostly, audio normalizers are used for balancing out the volume of music, podcast, or other audio recordings. Whenever you have a variety of audio clips that would sound too loud or soft if listened to together, an audio normalizer helps you create a more cohesive listening experience. So, why, and when, do we need to normalize our tracks?

* To make different music styles sound more cohesive;
* To adjust the volume of podcast to be at a consistent level with one another
* To remove sharp spikes in volume for consistent listening experience for our audiences

So, what are the types of audio normalization? Here you have it:

* **peak normalization** \- helps adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording;
* **loudness normalization** \- adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness;
* **RMS (Root-Mean-Square)** \- changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.

So, say that if you are a creator and have listeners, with this tool, you can count on the expectation that people will more likely want to convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners. This is what happens when audiences feel their user experience is favored and they enjoy a good content – it makes them come back for more.

But sometimes you don’t have so much time that would allow you to find a software, download its installer, install it, learn how to navigate inside its interface, which might be totally new and in some cases, complicated for you, and learn how to normalize your audio files there. In this case, you might want to find the right tools which would enable you to reach your goal without even having to install anything – simple and fast!

Hence, for this case, we would like to offer you the list of 10 best free online audio normalizers. The list goes:

1. MP3 Gain Volume Changer
2. Sodaphonic
3. Audio Mass
4. Audio Online Convert
5. Audio Editor
6. fConvert Online Converter
7. Boost MP3 Volume
8. MP3Cut Change Volume
9. Audio Alter Volume Changer
10. Audio Trimmer Volume Booster

Therefore, let’s delve into each one of them, and learn how to use those online editors in our favor!

## MP3 Gain Volume Changer

This online editor allows you to adjust the volume level of MP3 audio files fast – it can raise, lower, and normalize the volume level of your MP3 files.

The interface is simple and easy to use – exactly what you must be looking for. You can adjust the volume level to make the MP3 the way you want to listen to it.

One of the important things this app is letting you do is to upload from Google Drive or Desktop – it works locally without going through a server, and this means that MP3s do not need to be uploaded to any server.

So, go to this [link](https://mp3gain.flowsoft7.com/). Click on Choose Files and find the audio clip you would like to normalize.

![click on choose files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-1.jpg)

Now, once your audio track is added, head a little below and find the options you have.

![added audio track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-2.jpg)

Here, you can decide what do really do with your file: do you want to increase or decrease the volume? If you choose automatic normalization, the app will figure something out itself! And, look at the right side – in case you know well your decibels, you can choose how many decibels to apply. But the web-site itself says that 3.0 decibels is recommended, so it would be nice to just stick with it.

If you have multiple files and you want to normalize them all at once, click on Create MP3 (All); in case you have a lot of files and you would like to normalize one or more of them but not all, then your best choice would be Create MP3 (Selected). Another option is that you save your file on Google Drive.

When you Create your file(s), the normalized one(s) will appear under those buttons in Progress Log, and you can Play right away, or Download and listen to it later on.

![appear normalized file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-3.jpg)

## Sodaphonic

Sodaphonic also lets you edit your audio files online. With the help of this editor, you can cut, copy, and paste sound segments of an audio. It offers you: normalizing audio, using audio effects, time-stretching, reversing audio, fade-in and fade-out – those tools are really helpful.

[Sodaphonic](https://sodaphonic.com/editor) is pretty interesting as the first thing that meets the eye is that it lets you not only pick or drop an audio file there, but record something new, too!

![sodaphonic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-4.jpg)

Any option you choose, then when proceeding into the editor, you will see your file waveform there. In order to normalize the audio, on the top left, find Edit, put a cursor on it, and you will see the menu appear. Find Normalize and click on it.

![find and click on normalize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-5.jpg)

A little window will appear, where you need to fill in how many decibels should be set as the max peak.

![appear window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-6.jpg)

Once you do this and click on Normalize, your file will now be affected, and you can also compare the waveform – it is now a little different, isn’t it?

![file affected](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-7.jpg)

So, when you are happy with the result, just go to File, and Choose Export.

## Audio Mass

The window opened will show the option to Normalize Left and Right Equally, and it also doesn’t give you decibels – instead, you can choose the percentage on how you would like it to be normalized.

![choose percentage to normalize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-9.jpg)

Then, surely, click on the Normalize Audio button and enjoy the result – the waveform itself will show you how different the file becomes…

## "Mastering Multimedia Production on Chromebook with Audacity - Setup & Uninstall Guide"

Audacity has emerged as one of the greatest free audio editing tools for Mac, Linux, & Windows operating systems. With a wide range of capabilities and quality attributes, it is a basic and straightforward audio editing application. While Audacity for Chromebook and Chrome OS isn’t supported, does it imply you won't be utilizing them in the future? Not at all.

A few simple steps are all that is needed to have Audacity for Chromebook installed on your Chromebook. First, let's have a look at some of the features this device has to offer.

**Features of Audacity for Chromebook**

Audacity offers a wide range of editing features right inside its user-friendly interface, and it won't hold back when it comes to personalization even if it costs nothing. Because it has built-in dithering and is superbly compatible with 32-bit/384kHz audio, it's difficult to ignore this really effective open-source utility. Importing & mixing audio files is a breeze using Audacity, allowing you to combine stereo, mono, and even multitrack recordings. However, it's worth noting that there are now just a few possibilities for the latter.

In addition, Audacity for Chromebook has low system requirements, to the point where it works even if your PC is able to power on. Using this editing program, you may mix and match multiple audio formats and sample rates to create a single, cohesive piece of work. In addition, when it comes to editing, you'll enjoy the unparalleled ease of cutting, copying, and pasting, trimming to the sample level, duplicating, and even adding bespoke fades with the discretely introduced envelope tool.

Audacity seems to have all of the essential impacts. Whether you're looking for preset EQ curves like those found on a telephone or an AM radio, or Bass and Treble improvements, this versatile program has you covered. With the Auto-Duck tool, you may add a voiceover and other essential features to a podcast, such as a compressor, limiter reverb, and phaser reverb. It's an excellent choice if you don't have a lot of extra requirements. Even if you don't use it often, Audacity will be the last piece of editing software you ever buy.

## Installing Audacity for Chromebook

Apps for Chromebooks are often downloaded through the Google Play Store approach. However, sinceAudacity for Chromebook does not support our low-power systems, we must go the other route. To put it another way, you'll have to use Linux to get Audacity.

Linux is pre-installed on most Chromebooks, however, it is still in Beta. Go to the Settings menu and choose Enable from the drop-down menu to use this feature. Please go here for further information on how to enable Linux on your Chromebook. If your device has this wonderful function, you may follow the instructions below to properly install Audacity for Chromebook.

* Open the Linux Terminal in the Launcher.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step1.png)

This is what you'll see when you click on the Terminal.

* To begin installing Audacity, enter the following command in the Terminal window that has already opened.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step2.png)

* If you've done everything correctly up to this point, you'll be able to enjoy the full benefits of the Linux operating system. What follows instead is a bewildering cacophony of bluster.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step3.png)

* It seems that Linux is questioning whether or not you wish to proceed. To respond, use the "y" key on your keyboard.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step4.png)

This screenshot shows how the installation process is progressing.

* Finally, you'll notice the green-colored text at the finish of the orders. Your program has been successfully installed, as shown by this message.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step5.png)

* It's only a matter of selecting Audacity from the Launcher.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step6.png)

## How to Uninstall Audacity

Just like installing it, Audacity can be uninstalled with a few clicks. For this, execute the command below in the Linux Terminal (and you can copy & paste it).

**sudo apt remove audacity**

When this is done on Linux, you'll be asked whether you want to proceed with the uninstalling procedure or not. If you hit "y" the same way as previously, Audacity will be removed from your Chromebook in a matter of seconds.

A screenshot of Audacity in operation is here.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step5.png)

While recording your podcast using the built-in microphone on your Chromebook is a great way to start, it's not the only way to fine-tune the final product. You must drag the track and sound to the center of the screen in order to begin the magic with this program. Once you've done this, you'll be offered a variety of alternatives to get the editing process started.

Using Audacity for multitrack recording & editing is doable, but it's best to use non-linear tools if primary focus is on that element. Apart from that, Audacity is widely regarded as one of the best audio editors on the market.

## Conclusion

Your Chromebook may be able to run a variety of audio recording applications. As with Audacity, you won't be limited in your ability to produce high-quality music with a wide range of unique effects. We also go through Filmora's voice effects & how users may use them to change and improve their voices. Filmora allows you to re-voice video/audio & previously recorded voiceovers. For video/audio & voiceover files, the Pitch option on the Timeline may be used. Change the tone of a video and recording to make it sound different. You can quickly alter the voices in the videos using Filmora. Your viral should be accompanied by a story or a video. Using the Changing Pitch option, you may change the pitch of your voice. You may modify the pace of the video to change your voice (Optional). Make a duplicate of the video or audio that has been altered.

* If you've done everything correctly up to this point, you'll be able to enjoy the full benefits of the Linux operating system. What follows instead is a bewildering cacophony of bluster.

## How to Uninstall Audacity

Just like installing it, Audacity can be uninstalled with a few clicks. For this, execute the command below in the Linux Terminal (and you can copy & paste it).

**sudo apt remove audacity**

When this is done on Linux, you'll be asked whether you want to proceed with the uninstalling procedure or not. If you hit "y" the same way as previously, Audacity will be removed from your Chromebook in a matter of seconds.

A screenshot of Audacity in operation is here.

While recording your podcast using the built-in microphone on your Chromebook is a great way to start, it's not the only way to fine-tune the final product. You must drag the track and sound to the center of the screen in order to begin the magic with this program. Once you've done this, you'll be offered a variety of alternatives to get the editing process started.

Using Audacity for multitrack recording & editing is doable, but it's best to use non-linear tools if primary focus is on that element. Apart from that, Audacity is widely regarded as one of the best audio editors on the market.

## Conclusion

Your Chromebook may be able to run a variety of audio recording applications. As with Audacity, you won't be limited in your ability to produce high-quality music with a wide range of unique effects. We also go through Filmora's voice effects & how users may use them to change and improve their voices. Filmora allows you to re-voice video/audio & previously recorded voiceovers. For video/audio & voiceover files, the Pitch option on the Timeline may be used. Change the tone of a video and recording to make it sound different. You can quickly alter the voices in the videos using Filmora. Your viral should be accompanied by a story or a video. Using the Changing Pitch option, you may change the pitch of your voice. You may modify the pace of the video to change your voice (Optional). Make a duplicate of the video or audio that has been altered.
