However, Celebrity Voice Changer is currently only available in English and it cannot modulate speech in other languages.

* Huge selection of voice filters
* The app generates video files that are better adjusted to the audience on social media than audio files

In addition to hundreds of [video filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Snapchat also features a broad spectrum of voice changing effects that make Snaps more entertaining.

Using Snapchat will drain your battery quickly, which is why you must pay attention to how frequently you use this app.

**Pros**

* The easy voice modulation process
* Excellent messaging options
* Grants you access to a large community of likeminded people
