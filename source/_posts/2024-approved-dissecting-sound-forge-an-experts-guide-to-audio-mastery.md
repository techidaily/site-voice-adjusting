## Dissecting Sound Forge: An Expert's Guide to Audio Mastery

In the music industry, the audio content version has changed drastically. As a result, music production and marketing are growing faster than ever, and only those with proper, updated tools and skills are capable of surviving in this era.

Audio editing tools are in demand for different purposes, such as adding effects to audio and removing pauses from a webinar session. Choosing an audio editor depends on many factors, such as price range, the purpose of using an editor, and skill level. The best editing program can help you get the best audio finishing - MAGIX Sound Forge.

If you are new to the music industry or a professional searching for an audio editor, this article will help you learn everything about Sound Forge.

## Part 1\. A Quick Verdict of Sound Forge

Sound Forge is one of the best software for professionals, beginners, and enthusiasts due to its simple and essential restoration tools that can help remove unnecessary background noises. However, this music software can remove 70% of the noise, leaving some cracks and pops, but still, users get a lot of improvement in the audio quality.

You can record and extract audio from video files. The customizable toolbars, interfaces, and a wide variety of presets give you a complete audio editing experience with Sound Forge.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.

### [3\. Tongue Tied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI)

 This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

 This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)

 This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn't mean that it isn't interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.

 So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn't mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.
