**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/celebrity-voice-changer-face/id1111710488) 9.0 or later

**User Rating:** 4.0

In case you would like to sound like your favorite movie star of TV host, then Celebrity Voice Changer is one of the best choices you can make. Besides the standard set of options, the app also lets you request new voices since its machine learning technology can mimic virtually anyone's voice. However, Celebrity Voice Changer is currently only available in English and it cannot modulate speech in other languages.

**Pros**

* Automatic voice modulation
* Huge selection of voice filters
* The app generates video files that are better adjusted to the audience on social media than audio files
