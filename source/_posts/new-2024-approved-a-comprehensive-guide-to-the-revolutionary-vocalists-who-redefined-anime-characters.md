## How to Choose a DAW Software

Often, choosing the DAW software best suited to your needs can be confusing. However, a few simple questions will help you narrow down your list. Are recording instrumentals or live singing? Do you wish to use samples, in-built sounds, and loops? Are you low on budget?

Although DAW software can cost a fortune, many of these software's are accessible free with a few limitations. For instance, Studio One Prime V4, despite being free, does not support VST plug-ins. Similarly, Roland Zenbeats also requires money to be able to access additional features and VST plug-ins. One of the most favorite DAW software, namely Cakewalk by Bandlab, offers exceptional features complete with VST plug-in support but is limited to use on Windows only.

Hence, it seems like you can't have everything in one software. Even the best, free DAW software lack a feature or two. But despite lacking a few high-end features, the free DAW software's are productive enough, owing to the rapid technological advancements, to render your audios flawless and professional sounding.

## Conclusion

Irrespective of the fact that the above set of free DAW software is pretty easy than the others, each one of them requires some time to get accustomed. If you ever get stuck while handling the above best DAW for beginners, always remember to refer to the online learning videos that come handy to serve you better.

Once you get the hang of the software, you can easily manage it with ease.

## Part 2: How to Record Sounds Playing on Your Computer Using Audacity On Windows?

Unlike Mac, Windows makes it simple to capture audio from a movie or media file running on your desktop. There seem to be two primary methods for accomplishing audacity record desktop audio in this way:

**1\. Use MME as the Audio Host**

**Step 1:** To use MME as your audio host, go to **Tracks** in the **Add New** tab in **Stereo Track** and create a new file.

![record playing sound with audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-playing-computer-sound-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** Change the **Audio Host** (to the left of **Recording Device**) to **MME**—this is the standard setting, so you might not have to change anything.

![change audio host in audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-audio-host-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Choose desired option from the **Recording Device** dropdown menu. Based on your configuration, this might be referred to as **Wave Out** or **Loopback**. When you're uncertain, try it out.

![choose audio recording device in audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-recording-device-audacity.jpg)

**Step 4:** To record your audio source, click **Record**, then play it back.

**2\. Use WASAPI as the Audio Host**

WASAPI provides higher-resolution digital recordings. If capturing audio from an external monitor, it's also a good idea to utilize it.

## Part 4: How to Set up Audacity to Record as Schedule?

A streaming video recorder or cassette can be used to arrange a recording. All of those are identical to Time Recordings in that they are used to schedule recording. The Timer record configuration dialog box may be used to set the beginning and finish of the recording. This is how you do it:

**Step 1:** By definition, the recording's **Start Date and Time** are set to the present time. It will begin recording on the present day and hour by default when you don't alter it. There is no default setting for the **End Date and Time**. You must either choose a date and time to determine the end time.

![audacity schedule recording ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-set-start-end-schedule.jpg)

**Step 2:** There is a **Checkbox** to **Save** the work immediately. By **Ticking** the option, you may choose the path or **Folder** where the file will be saved when the recording is finished.
