## Elite Web-Based Audio Precision Tuning Tools

What is Audio Normalization, what are its different types, why do we need it and how to do it online? – these are the questions we might ask when first learning about it. Well, then, let’s answer all of them!

Audio Normalization means that the loudest parts of an audio signal are set to a specific value. For example, -18 dBFS (decibels relative to full scale). This is done so that all the parts of the sound mix remain at equal volume levels.

You can use this tool when mixing or editing your music, or during playback on your speakers. In the case of mixing, listen for any clipping (A form of waveform distortion - It sounds like the audio is starting to 'break up,' which is light distortion. The more severe it is, the more distorted the music begins to sound) that could occur in your mix. So, in this case, you need to normalize before it becomes too loud and needs more and more fixing. So, normalizing the audio kind of means balancing the volume of the track.

Mostly, audio normalizers are used for balancing out the volume of music, podcast, or other audio recordings. Whenever you have a variety of audio clips that would sound too loud or soft if listened to together, an audio normalizer helps you create a more cohesive listening experience. So, why, and when, do we need to normalize our tracks?

* To make different music styles sound more cohesive;
* To adjust the volume of podcast to be at a consistent level with one another
* To remove sharp spikes in volume for consistent listening experience for our audiences

So, what are the types of audio normalization? Here you have it:

* **peak normalization** \- helps adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording;
* **loudness normalization** \- adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness;
* **RMS (Root-Mean-Square)** \- changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.

So, say that if you are a creator and have listeners, with this tool, you can count on the expectation that people will more likely want to convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners. This is what happens when audiences feel their user experience is favored and they enjoy a good content – it makes them come back for more.

But sometimes you don’t have so much time that would allow you to find a software, download its installer, install it, learn how to navigate inside its interface, which might be totally new and in some cases, complicated for you, and learn how to normalize your audio files there. In this case, you might want to find the right tools which would enable you to reach your goal without even having to install anything – simple and fast!

Hence, for this case, we would like to offer you the list of 10 best free online audio normalizers. The list goes:

1. MP3 Gain Volume Changer
2. Sodaphonic
3. Audio Mass
4. Audio Online Convert
5. Audio Editor
6. fConvert Online Converter
7. Boost MP3 Volume
8. MP3Cut Change Volume
9. Audio Alter Volume Changer
10. Audio Trimmer Volume Booster

Therefore, let’s delve into each one of them, and learn how to use those online editors in our favor!

## MP3 Gain Volume Changer

This online editor allows you to adjust the volume level of MP3 audio files fast – it can raise, lower, and normalize the volume level of your MP3 files.

The interface is simple and easy to use – exactly what you must be looking for. You can adjust the volume level to make the MP3 the way you want to listen to it.

One of the important things this app is letting you do is to upload from Google Drive or Desktop – it works locally without going through a server, and this means that MP3s do not need to be uploaded to any server.

So, go to this [link](https://mp3gain.flowsoft7.com/). Click on Choose Files and find the audio clip you would like to normalize.

![click on choose files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-1.jpg)

Now, once your audio track is added, head a little below and find the options you have.

![added audio track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-2.jpg)

Here, you can decide what do really do with your file: do you want to increase or decrease the volume? If you choose automatic normalization, the app will figure something out itself! And, look at the right side – in case you know well your decibels, you can choose how many decibels to apply. But the web-site itself says that 3.0 decibels is recommended, so it would be nice to just stick with it.

If you have multiple files and you want to normalize them all at once, click on Create MP3 (All); in case you have a lot of files and you would like to normalize one or more of them but not all, then your best choice would be Create MP3 (Selected). Another option is that you save your file on Google Drive.

When you Create your file(s), the normalized one(s) will appear under those buttons in Progress Log, and you can Play right away, or Download and listen to it later on.

![appear normalized file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-3.jpg)

## Sodaphonic

Sodaphonic also lets you edit your audio files online. With the help of this editor, you can cut, copy, and paste sound segments of an audio. It offers you: normalizing audio, using audio effects, time-stretching, reversing audio, fade-in and fade-out – those tools are really helpful.

[Sodaphonic](https://sodaphonic.com/editor) is pretty interesting as the first thing that meets the eye is that it lets you not only pick or drop an audio file there, but record something new, too!

![sodaphonic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-4.jpg)

Any option you choose, then when proceeding into the editor, you will see your file waveform there. In order to normalize the audio, on the top left, find Edit, put a cursor on it, and you will see the menu appear. Find Normalize and click on it.

![find and click on normalize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-5.jpg)

A little window will appear, where you need to fill in how many decibels should be set as the max peak.

![appear window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-6.jpg)

Once you do this and click on Normalize, your file will now be affected, and you can also compare the waveform – it is now a little different, isn’t it?

![file affected](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-7.jpg)

So, when you are happy with the result, just go to File, and Choose Export.

## Audio Mass

The Audio Mass editor will help you edit audio and waveforms over the web. There, you can load any audio format your browser supports, and apply many different audio effects (fading in, cutting, trimming…)

The window opened will show the option to Normalize Left and Right Equally, and it also doesn’t give you decibels – instead, you can choose the percentage on how you would like it to be normalized.

![choose percentage to normalize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-9.jpg)

Then, surely, click on the Normalize Audio button and enjoy the result – the waveform itself will show you how different the file becomes…

## **Method 1: Remove Vocals Using Audacity Vocal Reduction Tool**

The first method of removing vocals in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is using the built-in vocal remover. This method is effective in completely removing vocals depending on how much processing is on the vocal. Even if the vocals are not completely removed, the method will reduce the volume significantly to give you great results. Let’s have a look at how to isolate vocal audacity with this method.

### **Step 1: Open Audacity**

The first thing you need to do is open the Audacity software in preparation for the vocal removal.

![open audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-1.JPG)

### **Step 2: Import the Audio Track**

![import audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-2.JPG)

### **Step 3: Select Audio Track**

Select the song or audio track from which you want to remove the vocals. This allows Audacity to load the waveform of the track into the editor.

![file import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-3.JPG)

### **Step 4: Export as MP3**

Backup the file so that you still have the whole song available for use later. Go to File > Export > Export as MP3\. Audacity will export the track in the original file format. If it was a WAV audio file, the export will be to that type. This ensures that the audio artifacts are kept in the best condition for editing. Be sure to name the exported file in something you will easily remember.

![export audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-4.JPG)

### **Step 5: Import the New Audio File**

Once you have exported the audio file, click “Close “on the original file. Then import the file you exported in the last step.

![import new audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-5.JPG)

### **Step 6: Apply Vocal Reduction and Isolation**

This method is a quick and easy way to remove vocals from any song in Audacity. It works best with any kind of song and will produce the edited track in just a matter of minutes. On the drawback, this method does not always wholly remove vocal and you may at times still hear bits of it. It may also remove other elements of the audio in addition to the vocal. Nonetheless, it is an effective approach that will work most of the time.

## **Method 2: Remove Vocals Using Audacity Splitting Audio Channels**

When working with songs or audio tracks with vocals in one channel and instruments in another, this is the best method to use. The Audacity vocal remover plugin gives you a simple way to separate the vocals and other sounds in an audio file. However, you cannot tell song that has multiple channels simply by looking at or listening to it. Therefore, you can try this method with any of your files and see the quality of the outcome. Here are the steps for this audacity separate vocals method:

### **Step 1: Import Your File**

Start by importing your audio track or song file into Audacity.

![import file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-8.JPG)

### **Step 2: Split Stereo to Mono**

In the title of the audio, click the Down Arrow. Then select Split Stereo to Mono.

![split stereo to mono](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-9.JPG)

### **Step 3: Play Solo**

Click on the Play button and choose Solo on each track. This allows you to see if there is any isolated vocal on either channel.

![play solo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-10.JPG)

### **Step 4: Delete Isolated Vocal**

From the results, delete the section that contains the isolated vocal from the Audacity session.

![delete isolated](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-11.JPG)

This alternative method is also effective in extract vocals Audacity. The main benefit is it has fewer steps than the first method.

Free of charge online application aimed at joining a few audio tracks into one. This service supports multiple formats and allows you to apply cross-fade mixing to an unlimited amount of tracks. Audio joiner works in the browser and doesn’t require installment of any applications. You just need to upload file, apply required effects and tap “Join” button - so you get the result.

### Steps on Using Audio Joiner

Once you arrive at Audio Joiner, you will be told to add music tracks of your choice, from files you have downloaded on your computer. As an example, I will be using the songs that I used to make the mashup that is playing during this presentation.

1) Start by clicking on "Add Tracks"

1) Click on the blue sliders on the bottom of the track and drag it left or right (or use your left/right arrow keys) to edit how long you want the song to play. You can also choose which part of the track to play specifically as well.

2) Your screen will open up to your files and ask you to select your songs. Choose as many music files (mp3 is best) as you want to add. For this example, I will be using 3 songs.

2) Just wait for it to join the files and.

3) Your finished! Just download your new mash-up and you're done! You are then able to resume editing your song, or start over with a new one.

## 3\. AUDIO JOINER

Audio Joiner is designed to merge several songs (mp3, m4a, wav, etc) into a single track. The program is absolutely free and operates online; therefore you don't need to install it on your computer. Just open the browser and start merging. Merge multiple audio files into a single track.

### Steps to Follow While Using an Audio Joiner

1. Open Online Audio Joiner website.
2. Add audio tracks.
3. Set the order of playback.
4. Adjust the intervals.
5. Select the mode of joining.
6. Next, click the “Join” button.
7. After the tracks have been joined, click “Download” link to save the composition on your hard drive.

## 4.ONLINE AUDIO JOINER

The Online Audio Combiner lets you convert your music file to a desired format and use crossfade between your merged songs. What does joining audio mean?

When you join audio files, you're combining them so multiple files will exist as a single audio file. There are both online audio joining sites and offline audio merging software programs you can use. You can delete those sections you don’t desire and then merge the other clips together to make a continuous file.

### How to Merge Audio Files Online

**STEP 1**

Select an audio file

To put your songs together, you can add two or more files from your PC, Mac, Android or iPhone. It's also possible to upload them from your Dropbox or Google Drive account. Each file can be up to 500 MB for free.

**STEP 2**

Combine MP3 and other audio

If you want, you can add more tracks to merge. Then drag and drop them until you're satisfied with the order. It's possible to convert and crossfade the music file if it's necessary. Take a look at the [how-to guide](https://clideo.com/resources/how-to-merge-audio-files) to understand better how to combine audio files.

**STEP 3**

Save the result

And it's done! Now you can listen to the joined audio to make sure you like it. If it's so, download it to your device or back to cloud storage. Otherwise, just go back to editing.

## CONCLUSION

Merging audios is combining several audio files into one. We usually select the songs whose styles are similar with each other. Then, we can adjust the playback speed and combine them into a new one. Besides, we can mix two songs. For example, we can mix the narrator’s words into a song. By this way, listeners can understand the meaning while enjoying the songs.
