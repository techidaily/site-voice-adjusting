## Converting Audio to Text With a Smartphone

Speech to text apps for Androids and iPhones can help you generate transcriptions of your audio and video files. Open an app like [Speechnotes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.speechnotes.speechnotes&hl=en%5FUS) on your Android device and play the file youâ€™d like to transcribe on your computer to start converting speech into text. Just keep in mind that the text files you create in this way canâ€™t be easily linked to their sources, so if you are looking for a quick way to generate subtitles for your videos, then some of the software products and online platforms we featured in this article are a much better option.

**Conclusion**

The process of converting speech into text doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be complicated. The online and computer-based speech to text apps can help you create transcriptions quickly, even though the results you will get may not be always entirely accurate. What is your favorite method of converting speech to text? Leave a comment, and let us know.
