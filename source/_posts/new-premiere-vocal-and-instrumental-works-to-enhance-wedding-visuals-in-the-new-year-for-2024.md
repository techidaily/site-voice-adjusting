The “Adjust Audio” functionality helps adjust the audio’s volume. You can also get rid of the background noise through “Audio Denoise.”

Moreover, the “Audio Ducking” feature lowers the background volume so that the dialogues can be heard more perfectly. The “Split Audio” splits the audio into different sections. You can also use the “Audio Mixer” to fine-tune the audio of your project easily. Review the different features and invest in the right software to have all required features under one platform.
