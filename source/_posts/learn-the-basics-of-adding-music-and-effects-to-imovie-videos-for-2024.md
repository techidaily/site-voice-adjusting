**Step #2\.** Then, choose **AUDIO**.

You will now be given three options. Soundtracks, My Music, and Songs in iCloud. Make your choice.

To listen to a soundtrack, tap it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, and then hit it again to preview it.

**Step #3\.** To add a soundtrack to your project, hit the **Add Audio** icon next to it. iMovie will automatically insert the music at the beginning of the project and adjust it to match the duration of the project.

**Adding sound effects**

When you add a sound effect, it is linked to the video clip above it in the timeline. When you move the video clip, the sound effect moves with it. This differs from soundtracks, which are separate from the video segments in your production.

Scroll the timeline with your project open until the play head (the white vertical line) appears where you wish to add the sound effect.

To browse the built-in sound effects, press the **Add Media** button, then **Audio**, then **Sound Effects**.

To hear a sound effect, tap it.

Tap the **Add Audio** button next to the sound effect to add it.

**Step #4\.** Adjust the volume of the clip

After you've added sound to your iMovie project, you may change the level of audio clips to achieve the ideal sound mix, or change the level of video clips that have sound. To change the volume of an audio or video clip, select it in the timeline, click the **Volume** button at the bottom of the window, and then drag the slider to raise or decrease the volume. When you completely reduce the volume of a clip, a **Mute** symbol displays on the clip in the timeline.

## Part 2\. How to Add Audio to iMovie on Mac?

iMovie for Mac comes with a library of music and sound clips that you may use in your project. In addition to sound effects such as rain and footsteps, iMovie includes audio clips such as ambiances and jingles.

**Step #1\.** With your project open, go to the top of the browser and select **Audio**, followed by **Sound Effects** in the sidebar on the left. To access the Media Browser, you may need to click the **Media Browser** button.

**Step #2\.** Hover the pointer over a jingle or sound clip in the list to preview it, and then click the play button next to the sound clip. You may also preview a song or sound clip by selecting it, clicking on the waveform at the top of the media browser, and then pressing the Spacebar.

**Step #3\.** Drag jingles or other audio clips to the music well, represented by the musical note icon in the timeline, to create background music for your film. The video clips in the timeline have no effect on the audio in the music well.

**Step #4\.** To add music or sound effects to a video clip, drag it under the video clip until a bar linking the clips appears. When you move the connected video clip, the audio follows.

## Part 3\. How to Add Audio to iMovie from iTunes?

If you want to add songs such as M4P music and Apple Music from iTunes to iMovie but discover that all of the music is protected, all you need is the **Sidify Apple Music Converter**. Sidify Apple Music Converter enables you to download music without quality loss. One of Sidify's distinctive advantages is its ability to remove protection at an extremely quick rate – up to 20 times faster than any other similar program. The software's user interface is straightforward. The program is simple to use even for inexperienced users. In this section, we'll teach you how to add M4P music and Apple Music to an iMovie project as background music.

**What you'll need:**

* A Mac or Windows computer running macOS or Windows OS
* The most recent version of iTunes
* Sidify Apple Music Converter is available
* Sidify Apple Music Converter can now play Apple Music

Launch Sidify Apple Music Converter, click the **+** button, and all the tunes you've downloaded from Apple Music will appear in the adding music window, as seen below. Select the song to be converted and click **OK**.

### Step 1\. Select a file type

You may select an output format such as MP3, M4A, WAV, FLAC, or AIFF, as well as a conversion speed of up to 10X and an output quality of up to 320 Kbps.

## Part 4\. How to Add Audio to iMovie from Spotify?

Offline playback is possible with a Spotify Premium membership. You may save songs, playlists, or albums to listen to later. The essential element to remember is that Spotify music, whether online or offline, can only be accessed through the Spotify application. To put it another way, you do not have permission to import Spotify music into other third-party software programs. It comes with iMovie and other video editing software.

**Step #1\.** Import music from Spotify into **AudFree**. The AudFree Spotify converter must be compatible with the Spotify app. When you run AudFree program from your computer's desktop, Spotify will immediately load. You may now begin to uncover preferred Spotify tunes to add to iMovie. Import them into AudFree by copying and pasting or dragging and dropping.

**Step #2\.** Set the output format and other preferences for iMovie. MP3, WAV, M4A, and AIFF are all supported by iMovie. You may go to the top menu and select 'Preferences' > 'Convert'. A setting window will appear. You may select one of the iMovie-supported audio formats as the output format in the window. You can also change the output parameters.

**Step #3\.** Spotify tracks may be converted for use in iMovie. To begin the download, click the 'Convert' button in the bottom-right corner of the main screen. AudFree program will download Spotify music to target iMovie files at up to 5X quicker speeds. You should disable your antivirus or firewall to make the converting process more stable.

02 [5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor](#part2)

## Part 1\. What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor

Have you ever looked at the internet and the number of options you get whenever you search for MP3 tag editor Mac free? The page is all packed and loaded with tons of different options. No doubt it's tough to select a good tag editor, but what if we tell you some tricks for selecting a great Mac music tag editor? Without any further delay, let’s begin.

### · Easy to User Interface

A primary factor that is considered while selecting any tool, the editor, is its interface. If any software offers a complex interface, users don't prefer it. An easy interface means all the editing, manipulating, adding, deleting options appear on the front. Users don't have to struggle to find basic options.

### · Online Database Search

If any macOS MP3 tag editor offers an online database search means it’s a good editor. This is because not all editors support online search. The option is very helpful as the online search shares all the information related to any searched tag.

### · Editing Options

How many editing options do you prefer? Editing metadata means that you should be able to edit and manipulate as many fields as possible. For instance, the Mac music tag editor should allow changing the singer's name, year tag, and all the other fields.

### · Batch Processing

Editing is a stressful and hectic job. Is there a way to help yourself? Let’s share about Batch Processing. If the Mac MP3 tag editor allows batch processing, then it's a great choice. This is because editing individually can take hours, but batch processing reduces the editing time as well as the editing efforts.

### · Supported Formats

## How to Choose a DAW Software

Often, choosing the DAW software best suited to your needs can be confusing. However, a few simple questions will help you narrow down your list. Are recording instrumentals or live singing? Do you wish to use samples, in-built sounds, and loops? Are you low on budget?

Although DAW software can cost a fortune, many of these software's are accessible free with a few limitations. For instance, Studio One Prime V4, despite being free, does not support VST plug-ins. Similarly, Roland Zenbeats also requires money to be able to access additional features and VST plug-ins. One of the most favorite DAW software, namely Cakewalk by Bandlab, offers exceptional features complete with VST plug-in support but is limited to use on Windows only.

Hence, it seems like you can't have everything in one software. Even the best, free DAW software lack a feature or two. But despite lacking a few high-end features, the free DAW software's are productive enough, owing to the rapid technological advancements, to render your audios flawless and professional sounding.

## Conclusion

Irrespective of the fact that the above set of free DAW software is pretty easy than the others, each one of them requires some time to get accustomed. If you ever get stuck while handling the above best DAW for beginners, always remember to refer to the online learning videos that come handy to serve you better.

Once you get the hang of the software, you can easily manage it with ease.
