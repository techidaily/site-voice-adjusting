## Amplifying the Listener Experience: Where to Obtain Professional Podcast Sound Effects

Different tools are useful for inserting the best sound effects into such shows. Let's learn which ones they are and how they work.

## Benefits of Adding Sound Effects in Podcasts

Before discussing what tools can help editors add sound effects to podcast episodes, we should refresh on why it is vital. Here are some of the best benefits you can expect from inserting sound effects for podcasts:

* **Thematic or mood setting**

With a sound effect, you can portray a specific theme for your podcast that gives the users an instant feel of your brand/channel. For example, if a podcaster is creating a podcast show for the True Crime genre, spooky and moody background sound effects set the mood. Comedy or commentary podcasts can use mood-based sound effects like a laugh track with their content.

* **Point emphasis**

Many podcasters utilize sound effects at pivotal moments of their content, e.g., to emphasize a cliffhanger in story-form podcast episodes. Like the boding and italicizing methods are useful in text documents to emphasize parts, you can adjust sound effects to do the same for your audio-based content. These can accentuate the dialogue and evoke specific emotional responses from the audience.

* **Transition points**

Most podcasters utilize the **best sound effects for podcast** shows to act as a transition between conversational segments. For example, some use these effects as outros or intros.

### **FAQs about Free Audio Editors**

#### 1\. What is the best software to edit audio?

It depends on your needs. If you are looking for the best free software to edit audio, Audacity is a great choice. However, if you work in the music industry, Adobe [Audition](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is very popular among musicians due to its irreplaceable functionalities.

#### 2\. Is GarageBand better than Audacity?

Both GarageBand and Audacity are the most commonly used free audio editing tools. However, they differ in several aspects. GarageBand can only work on macOS and iOS products, but Audacity can work on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Then one of the biggest differences between them is GarageBand is remarkable for making music, but Audacity is more like an audio editing tool. That's why we can't simply say GarageBand is better than Audacity because everyone has different purposes when choosing tools.

#### 3\. Can I record my voice over a music file using WavePad?

You cannot record your voice directly over the music file with WavePad; however, you can create a second voice file and combine the tracks using the Paste Mix tool.
