Microphone selection is a crucial component in making sound effects during recording. You use sensitive mics for interior scenes to capture subtle nuances make good audio. Here we preferably recommend hyper-cardioid condenser mics.

Consider also placement and closeness of the microphone as they significantly affect the sound effect recorded concerning the sound source. For close-up shots, use closer microphone placement, but if you desire more room sound, put distance between the mic and the sound source.
