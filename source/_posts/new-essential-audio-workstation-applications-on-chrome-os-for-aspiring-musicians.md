As a beginner, you must first fully understand what a digital audio workstation is doing if you are going to decide which DAW is the best for you.

[DAW stands for Digital Audio Workstation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Initially, DAWs were designed to find an alternative to tape recording. The computer-based DAWs and digital audio tracks are recorded.

A DAW is a virtual studio within your computer. There are many platforms on which you can create DAW because of technological advancement, be it Windows, Mac, Chrome OS, or even your phone!

Out of all, the fastest and most economical way is through Chromebook. Below you will find a list of the best DAW for Chromebook, supported by Chrome OS to create music.

* [**Part 1: 8 Best DAW for Chromebook**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad**](#part2)

## Part 1: 8 Best DAW for Chromebook

### 1\. [Soundtrap.com](https://www.soundtrap.com/)

Soundtrap is a sleek, easy-to-use, efficient DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that runs on your computer. You will need to create an account to start using the browser app, which will also give you a trial of their premium features. Once the trial is over, you will be downgraded to a free account with certain limitations.

**Features**

* There are several instruments and loops that you can play with and make music.
* You can also connect a MIDI-compatible device and record music to the app.
* Soundtrap even has networking and collaboration apps that encourage you to share your music ideas with your mates, and they'll be able to listen to and also edit your songs.

If you are a novice or a skilled musician, the Flat.io music composition app offers you all the resources you need to create your sheet music. You can compose, read, upload, and discover music scores on any computer right in your web browser. Chromebook sponsors it, so the core concept behind this app is that you can quickly exchange your music with your peers.

* Just as multiple people can edit a Google Doc at once, multiple people can edit a score in Flat at the same time.
* Create your score, choose "Share" and invite people with "read" or "write" permissions to score.

Magix is well known for a variety of music tech products: Music Maker, Samplitude, Acid Music Studio / Acid Pro, and Sound Forge.

BandLab is a free browser DAW for Chromebook that you would expect to be a straightforward DAW. Bandlab DAW only works in Chrome, and your phone has a version.

**Features**

* There are some pretty high-shelf functions, such as tap-tempo, magnetic timeline, lyric editor, and tracking version.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4742929&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/e09fdffe648a30658a9657bbed7b2388/products/boxshot(2).png" border="0">Kanto Player Professional</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.
