It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.

Let us start:

* Open Filmora and import your audio.
* Drag the audio into the timeline in the audio layer.
* Now click on the audio in the timeline, and you will find a blue line inside this layer.
* Drag that blue line up and down, you will find when you go up the volume will become louder and when you drag the audio down the volume will be lower.

### 2\. How can I remove background noise from recordings in Filmora?

Usually, when you increase the volume of your audio the noise in the background will also increase so this feature is very important.

* Now click on the **auto normalization**, this will help to level up the volume of the audio.  
While making audio, we have different tones of the volume. Sometimes we speak loud with more energy and sometimes we have low volume and this auto normalization feature will help to adjust the level of the whole audio.  
In this latest version of Filmora, we have two more features that are **wind removal** and hum removal.
* Click on the **hum removal**, it removes the humming noise in the recorded audio.
* Click on the **wind removal**, it automatically removes the sound of the wind which will make your audio clear.
* Finally, press **Ok**.
