## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![options showed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png)

**Step 6:** Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.

**Step 7:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

### 2\. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself

## Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.

**Step 1:** Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.

![scary sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png)

Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.

![scary sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png)

**Step 3:** Afterward, click on your browser's search bar and type <www.y2mate.com>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png)

**Step 4:** Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.

**Step 5:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![options showed](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png)

**Step 6:** Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.

**Step 7:** Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.

![download the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-1.png)

That will download the entirety of the video in audio format only. All of this is free. Later in this article, we will show you how to cut and trim it.

### 2\. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself

If you are not satisfied with other scary sound effects or want something unique, you can make your sound effects. Initially, get a good-quality microphone with a pop filter for clear audio.

**Be Sure To Be In a Quiet Room with Padding:**

Connect the microphone to your computer make sure it is unmuted physically by pressing its button, as some microphones have a mute button on them.

**Make Sure the Microphone Is Unmuted In the Software:**

**Step 1:** Open a recording software, such as OBS Studio or audio recorder from Windows.

**Step 2:** Press record and make the sound effect you want.

**Step 3:** End the recording by pressing stop recording. You will now have recorded a scary music sound effect saved on your computer.

### 3\. Getting Sound Effects from Free Websites

This option is attractive to many people, from beginners to people testing out the waters of audio editing. However, it should be noticed that the sound quality is not the best.

You can get free sound effects from websites such as Freesound.com or Soundeffectsplus.com.

**Step 1:** First of all, go to the website.

**Step 2:** Register an account

**Step 3:** Then search your desired sound effect

![search the effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-7.png)

**Step 4:** Press download next to it.

Pretty straightforward, and as mentioned, these are free, but with limitations such as total download amount per month or licensing.

### 4\. Buying Sound Effects

If you have money but not time to make your audio effects, you can buy sound effects off the internet. Usually, these sellers have excellent quality audio; they can even make specific sound effects tailored to your needs.

* Many websites sell sound effects, including the likes of – <www.prosoundeffects.com> and <www.soundsnap.com>.

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

* [Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster](#part1)
* [Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application](#part2)
* [Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin](#part3)
* [Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora](#part4)

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

![select spatial sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg)

3\. Pick the Bass Boost (or any of your profiles) and hit the **Settings** key to make adjustments. This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.

![bass boost settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-bass-boost-settings.jpg)

4\. To get to the Windows **Video Playback** settings, click the **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Video Playback**, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.

![video playback settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg)

5\. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.

![hd color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-hd-color-settings.jpg)

## Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application

Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.

1\. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.

![equalizer application menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg)

2\. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.

![apply equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-apply-equalizer.jpg)

3\. The arrow mentioned in the below picture can change **booster sound**. The sound wave will shift, and the maximum will come out; just split it with an equalizer, so it's probably best to lower the boost to avoid cutting.

![change booster-sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-change-booster-sound.jpg)

4\. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins/VST plugin.

![insert limiter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-insert-limiter.jpg)

5\. The VST container will be inserted at the end of the process.

![vst container](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-vst-container.jpg)

6\. Hit upon the file option.

![hit file option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-hit-file-option.jpg)

7\. Click the VST file when the VST preview window opens (extension .dll). VST 2 is the only format that is supported. Because there is no connection feature, you must use VST with the same number of items as Equalizer APO. Now VST can be loaded.

![load vst equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-load-vst-equalizer.jpg)

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

![open panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-open-panel.jpg)

9\. The user interface is visible now. Kindly remember that, unlike DAW, the setting may not be applied until you hit the "**OK**" or "**Apply**" buttons. If "**Apply automatically**" is selected, the settings will be displayed instantly, just as in DAW.

![apply automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-apply-automatically.jpg)

## Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin

Another effective way to increase volume without any hassle is by using the Chrome extension. For this purpose, the Volume Master extension serves to boost volume without affecting audio quality. This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.

With a simple slider, the usability and convenience of this extension are impressive. Through this, you can enhance, reduce, or increase the volume of a specific tab without affecting the default web browser or system volume settings.

There are three steps to increase volume by using the chrome booster volume plugin.

1\. First, open **Google Chrome**, then move to **Chrome Web Store**. By searching the **Volume Master** here, you will be directed to the link which will open the extension page. Here hit the **Add to Chrome button**.

![add volume master](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-add-volume-master.jpg)

2\. A dialogue box will appear. When requested, click the **Add Extension** button to confirm.

![add extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-add-extension.jpg)

3\. Click on the extension icon in the right top corner after adding the extension. Now set the volume how much you want it to be boosted as shown in the mentioned slider.

![volume booster plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/17-volume-booster-plugin.jpg)

4\. To get to the Windows **Video Playback** settings, click the **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Video Playback**, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.

![video playback settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg)

5\. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.

## Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application

Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.

1\. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.

![equalizer application menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg)

2\. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.

![apply equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-apply-equalizer.jpg)

3\. The arrow mentioned in the below picture can change **booster sound**. The sound wave will shift, and the maximum will come out; just split it with an equalizer, so it's probably best to lower the boost to avoid cutting.

![change booster-sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-change-booster-sound.jpg)

4\. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins/VST plugin.

![insert limiter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-insert-limiter.jpg)

5\. The VST container will be inserted at the end of the process.

![vst container](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-vst-container.jpg)

6\. Hit upon the file option.

![hit file option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-hit-file-option.jpg)

7\. Click the VST file when the VST preview window opens (extension .dll). VST 2 is the only format that is supported. Because there is no connection feature, you must use VST with the same number of items as Equalizer APO. Now VST can be loaded.

![load vst equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-load-vst-equalizer.jpg)

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

![open panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-open-panel.jpg)

9\. The user interface is visible now. Kindly remember that, unlike DAW, the setting may not be applied until you hit the "**OK**" or "**Apply**" buttons. If "**Apply automatically**" is selected, the settings will be displayed instantly, just as in DAW.

![apply automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-apply-automatically.jpg)

## Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin

Another effective way to increase volume without any hassle is by using the Chrome extension. For this purpose, the Volume Master extension serves to boost volume without affecting audio quality. This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.

With a simple slider, the usability and convenience of this extension are impressive. Through this, you can enhance, reduce, or increase the volume of a specific tab without affecting the default web browser or system volume settings.

There are three steps to increase volume by using the chrome booster volume plugin.

1\. First, open **Google Chrome**, then move to **Chrome Web Store**. By searching the **Volume Master** here, you will be directed to the link which will open the extension page. Here hit the **Add to Chrome button**.

![add volume master](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-add-volume-master.jpg)

2\. A dialogue box will appear. When requested, click the **Add Extension** button to confirm.

![add extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-add-extension.jpg)

3\. Click on the extension icon in the right top corner after adding the extension. Now set the volume how much you want it to be boosted as shown in the mentioned slider.
