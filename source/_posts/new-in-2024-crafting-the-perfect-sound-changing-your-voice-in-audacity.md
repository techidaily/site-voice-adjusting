After you detach the audio to the audio track, you can double click it on the track, and then you will see the Fade in and Fade out options (there are also some other audio settings such as volume, equalizer, and denoise). Just drag the slider on the Fade in and Fade out option to make smooth audio transitions directly, and then you will see the fade-in and fade-out waves on the timeline. All of this will make the editing very dramatic and full of personality.

#### Step 4\. Add Sound Effects
