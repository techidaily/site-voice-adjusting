### **1\. Extract Drums from a Song Online With A Web App**

Using an online web app is one of the easiest ways to extract drums from your song tracks. This is a great approach for beginners or people who do not have production experience. Probably you do not want to waste time finding the audio files, converting them from iTunes, and bringing them into a DAW. A digital audio workstation (DAW) is an electronic system that is designed for recording, editing, and playing back digital audio files. It usually plays the following functions:

* Loading and editing audio
* Recording new tracks
* Mixing and applying effects
* Mastering
* Exporting finished mixes

After bringing the files to the DAW, you still have to remove drums manually for the song. The process will have a lot of clicking and file management that will take time and extra effort. With a web app drum extractor, the process is super easy. Take [Moises.ai](https://moises.ai/), for instance, users extract drums from any public media URL in minutes.

![moises.ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG)

This makes it a great choice when removing drums from music on SoundCloud or the latest video of YouTube. Why would you try Moises.ai?

* **Cloud-based AI application** – Effectively extracts drums from any public media URL
* **User-friendly UI** – The platform is simple and easy to use for all experience levels
* **Keep Track of Progress** – The Moises.ai dashboard keeps a library of all songs you have isolated, allowing you to playback and download on-demand
* **Download Separate Files** – Once your original audio file has been separated, you can download the vocals, drums, beats, and bass files to your local PC
* **Free Version is Available** – Try out the service on the free version before committing your money

Although some tracks will not isolate the best with this web app, it gets the work done. Once you download the files, it is easy to bring the songs into DAW to play along. The process makes it simple to create drum covers fast that you can play along with other web mixers.

### **2\. Extract Drums from a Song Online with VST Plugins**

For those who want to do more of the work, VST plugins for removing drums from music are a great option. These are software modules that take the form of real-time effects or instruments. They may also have MIDI effects, giving more freedom with audio editing, The inability to adjust or customize settings when extracting drums from a soundtrack is one of the major downfalls of a web-based application. With VST plugins, this issue is no longer a concern.

![vst plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/remove-drums-from-a-song-easy-tips-and-tricks-2.JPG)

With VSTs, you are more flexible and able to deliver better results. They are often used in applications that support VST technology, including Cakewalk Sonar, Steinberg Cubase, Sound Forge Pro, Ableton Live, and many others. Some of the most common ones include:

* AudioSourceRe
* UNMIX Drums
* XTrax Stem 2
* Drum Extract

VST plugins are great for customizing your audio results. You have two ways to remove drums from a song using a VST plugin and DAW: using a compressor or an equalizer. When good results are not forthcoming, you can try to EQ or equalize frequencies that seem out of the soundtrack. This will lower the perceived volume of the drums, providing clearer vocals. Another approach is to use a parametric equalizer by reducing the frequencies by some dB for precise results.

* 4k (cymbals)
* 90 Hz (kick drum)
* 150 Hz (snare drum)

Just play around with the EQ, mixing your drum tracks above the recordings. The end will be your kit’s flaming against the original recording for perfect results.
