### Steps on Using Audio Joiner

Once you arrive at Audio Joiner, you will be told to add music tracks of your choice, from files you have downloaded on your computer. As an example, I will be using the songs that I used to make the mashup that is playing during this presentation.

1) Start by clicking on "Add Tracks"

1) Click on the blue sliders on the bottom of the track and drag it left or right (or use your left/right arrow keys) to edit how long you want the song to play. You can also choose which part of the track to play specifically as well.

2) Your screen will open up to your files and ask you to select your songs. Choose as many music files (mp3 is best) as you want to add. For this example, I will be using 3 songs.

2) Just wait for it to join the files and.

3) Your finished! Just download your new mash-up and you're done! You are then able to resume editing your song, or start over with a new one.

## 3\. AUDIO JOINER

Audio Joiner is designed to merge several songs (mp3, m4a, wav, etc) into a single track. The program is absolutely free and operates online; therefore you don't need to install it on your computer. Just open the browser and start merging. Merge multiple audio files into a single track.

### Steps to Follow While Using an Audio Joiner

1. Open Online Audio Joiner website.
2. Add audio tracks.
3. Set the order of playback.
4. Adjust the intervals.
5. Select the mode of joining.
6. Next, click the “Join” button.
7. After the tracks have been joined, click “Download” link to save the composition on your hard drive.

## 4.ONLINE AUDIO JOINER

The Online Audio Combiner lets you convert your music file to a desired format and use crossfade between your merged songs. What does joining audio mean?

When you join audio files, you're combining them so multiple files will exist as a single audio file. There are both online audio joining sites and offline audio merging software programs you can use. You can delete those sections you don’t desire and then merge the other clips together to make a continuous file.

### How to Merge Audio Files Online

**STEP 1**

Select an audio file

To put your songs together, you can add two or more files from your PC, Mac, Android or iPhone. It's also possible to upload them from your Dropbox or Google Drive account. Each file can be up to 500 MB for free.

**STEP 2**

Combine MP3 and other audio

If you want, you can add more tracks to merge. Then drag and drop them until you're satisfied with the order. It's possible to convert and crossfade the music file if it's necessary. Take a look at the [how-to guide](https://clideo.com/resources/how-to-merge-audio-files) to understand better how to combine audio files.

**STEP 3**

Save the result

And it's done! Now you can listen to the joined audio to make sure you like it. If it's so, download it to your device or back to cloud storage. Otherwise, just go back to editing.

## CONCLUSION

Merging audios is combining several audio files into one. We usually select the songs whose styles are similar with each other. Then, we can adjust the playback speed and combine them into a new one. Besides, we can mix two songs. For example, we can mix the narrator’s words into a song. By this way, listeners can understand the meaning while enjoying the songs.
