## Part 1: What is audio ducking?

The concept of audio ducking is simple. In a soundtrack, you can find a wide range of music playing in the background. Audio ducking is the process of suppressing one type of audio signal and increasing the other movement simultaneously without causing any issues. Mostly audio ducking is processed for movies or any live sessions that reduce the background music when the characters or person speaks on the screen and increases the speaker's volume. The scenario happens vice versa when the speaker completes its conversation. Here, the background music increases, and the speaker's audio is reduced drastically. This type of audio ducking occurs to enhance the audio quality and reach the target audience without any issues.

![Audio-ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/audio-ducking.jpg)

The automatic changes with the audio volume are triggered by a common control using the audio ducking settings. When you enable this option in your device, this module is programmed to balance the volume settings as per the requirements. The audio ducking process allows the audio files to sound better by improving the quality of the audio signals. The audio parameters are adjusted at the specific track in the audio clippings to enhance the overall quality of the audio file.

You will be able to feel the difference when the audio tracks are played. Use the audio ducking feature optimally to strengthen the crucial audio signals when required. Identify the perfect sound spots at the audio file that requires this ducking feature. Implement this feature at particular spots to enjoy the benefits of this audio ducking functionality. It serves as a boon for sound editors and creates a positive impact on the audio files.
