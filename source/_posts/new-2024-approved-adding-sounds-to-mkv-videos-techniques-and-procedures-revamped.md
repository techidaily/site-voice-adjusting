 You may come across the same problem: want to add audio to MKV but find video editing tools like Mkvmerge doesn’t work. Well, then what’s the available way to do so?

![remove audio from mkv](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Add audio to MKV

 Now what you have to do is to drop the video file to the Video track in the Timeline and audio to the Audio Track. Then you can make the audio file fit your video by trimming or double click the audio file to set fade in/out effects, speed up or slow down it, adjust volume so that it doesn't drown out the original audio of your video, etc. If you want to remove the original audio, just right click the video in Timeline and select “Audio Detach” and press “Delete” to remove audio from video.

 Besides adding an audio file, you can also use Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) to record and add your own voiceover. To do this, simply click the “Record” button on the toolbar and record the voiceover in the Record Audio window. Click the red button to get started and “OK” to save it and return to the main interface. The recorded voiceover will then appear in the audio track. Then adjust its position, volume, etc., just like any audio files.

Here are various choices for you: export the video to various video formats, convert the video to play on different mobile devices, upload the video to YouTube instantly or burn video to DVD disc.

Moving images are far less convincing if they are not accompanied by sound. That is the reason why all of the [glitch visual effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you add to your videos are going to be much more impactful if you add sound effects to them. Making glitch sound effects on your own can prove to be a demanding task, especially if you are not a skilled sound designer, but luckily you can solve this problem by downloading the effect that fits a particular sequence perfectly from the Internet. So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online destinations where you can find a huge number of different glitch effects you can use in all of your projects for free.

If you are running the latest version of [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or version after V10.5, you can now find the glitch sound in the Audio library directly by typing glitch in the search bar.

![Filmora free glitch sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/glitch-sound-filmora.jpg)

You can then directly drag the audio to the track in the timeline and edit it accordingly.

Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.
