### When you save a Podcast, where does it go?

Saved Podcasts are usually added to the saved list in your Podcast library and will be available for offline listening. But if you want to get access directly on your computer, then you need a third-party tool to download it from the Podcast manager app to your PC, as mentioned above in the article.

### Is listening to a Podcast the same as downloading?

No. Podcast download involves saving a Podcast episode to your Podcast app. But listening to a Podcast refers to the number of times you played a Podcast.
