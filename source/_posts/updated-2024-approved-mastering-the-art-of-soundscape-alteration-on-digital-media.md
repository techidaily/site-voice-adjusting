Want a program that can change audio volume so that it won’t be too loud or too quiet? Though many media players or speakers have volume control during playback, it still can be an annoying problem and it takes time to set it. And some downloaded files are rather low to listen to even you raise the volume to the maximum level on the computer. So it's advisable to **normalize the volume** permanently.

![Change Volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-volume.jpg)

Thanks to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a professional video editing tool that makes it remarkably easy to increase/decrease the audio level to a professional sound. Below I’ll describe how to do this in a few clicks.

**Note**: This program is available on both Windows and Mac platforms. Below guide, I’ll take the Windows screenshots. For users who want to adjust the audio volume on Mac, just follow the same steps using [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 1\. Import your media files

Note that almost all video & audio formats supported, including WMV, MOV, AVI, MKV, MP4, MPG, MPEG, MOD, DV, MTS, avchd, M2TS, TS, MP3, MKA, and so on.

#### 2\. Change audio volume with ease

It is not easy to work with Adobe Audition. It's also likely that you'll get confused with vocal remover Adobe Audition. Although Adobe Audition provides dozens of tools for ease of use, it is a powerful audio editing program.

The Center Channel Extractor effects and its vocal remover preset can be used to remove vocals in Adobe Audition.

### Step 1\. Prepare for [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) by importing media

You can import your audio files and media files into Adobe Audition.

![adobe audition import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-2.jpg)

### Step 2\. Click on the Effect Rack

Select the "Effects" rack once the audio file has been imported into Adobe Audition.

![adobe audition click effect rack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-3.jpg)

Altеrnativеly, choose one of the effects using thе arrows on thе right sidе of thе scrееn. If you click on thе whitе arrow you will opеn a dropdown list. Stereo imagery is available by just simply putting your mouse cursor over it. The Center Channel Extractor will be displayed in a new list.

![adobe audition click stereo imagery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-4.jpg)

### Step 3\. Select "Remove Vocal"

After you click on Central Channel Extractor, you should see the effect window. You can change the default Preset to Vocal Remove by clicking on the dropdown menu. Besides Acapella, Sing Along, and Karaoke, the effect also has presets for these types of tracks. The vocals will be removed from the instrumentals this time if you select Vocal Remove. It's easy to see that your vocals have been reduced when you preview it.

![adobe audition click vocal remove](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-5.jpg)

Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

### Step 4\. Customize the Setting

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this. As a result, the vocals in the center are attenuated and minimized. You can see it highlighted as 2.

![adobe audition customise setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-6.jpg)

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

![adobe audition set frequency](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-7.jpg)

Proceed to the Discrimination Tab once you have finished these settings. By identifying the center channel, you can further refine your audio. There are 5 sliders, largely focused on two: Crossover Bleed and Phase Discrimination. After picking the Acapella preset, these sliders handle the bleed of the instrumentals.

![click discrimination](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-8.jpg)

### Step 5\. Apply the Effect

On the Effects Rack panel, click Apply at the bottom of the effect window. Your audio file's length may determine the amount of time it takes Adobe Audition to apply the effects.

![adobe audition apply effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-9.jpg)

### Step 6\. The Instrument Track Needs to be Exported

To use the music tracks on your mix or videos, export them without vocals. Go to Filе/Export/Filе to еxport a filе. Thе audio format for thе nеw music filе you can sеlеct rangеs from MP3, WAV, FLAC, AIFF and many othеrs.

For video editing software such as Premiere Pro, use a Sample Type of 48 kHz. Audio engineers who work with video media usually prefer 48 kHz sample rates.

![adobe audition click export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-10.jpg)

A Tip for Enhancing Results

To get perfect results, I recommend always listening back while you adjust these sliders, since audio quality varies from one to another.

The Center Channel Extractor effects and its vocal remover preset can be used to remove vocals in Adobe Audition.

### Step 1\. Prepare for [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) by importing media

You can import your audio files and media files into Adobe Audition.

![adobe audition import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-2.jpg)

### Step 2\. Click on the Effect Rack

Select the "Effects" rack once the audio file has been imported into Adobe Audition.

![adobe audition click effect rack](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-3.jpg)

Altеrnativеly, choose one of the effects using thе arrows on thе right sidе of thе scrееn. If you click on thе whitе arrow you will opеn a dropdown list. Stereo imagery is available by just simply putting your mouse cursor over it. The Center Channel Extractor will be displayed in a new list.

![adobe audition click stereo imagery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-4.jpg)

### Step 3\. Select "Remove Vocal"

After you click on Central Channel Extractor, you should see the effect window. You can change the default Preset to Vocal Remove by clicking on the dropdown menu. Besides Acapella, Sing Along, and Karaoke, the effect also has presets for these types of tracks. The vocals will be removed from the instrumentals this time if you select Vocal Remove. It's easy to see that your vocals have been reduced when you preview it.

![adobe audition click vocal remove](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-5.jpg)

Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

### Step 4\. Customize the Setting

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this. As a result, the vocals in the center are attenuated and minimized. You can see it highlighted as 2.

![adobe audition customise setting](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-6.jpg)

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

![adobe audition set frequency](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-7.jpg)

Proceed to the Discrimination Tab once you have finished these settings. By identifying the center channel, you can further refine your audio. There are 5 sliders, largely focused on two: Crossover Bleed and Phase Discrimination. After picking the Acapella preset, these sliders handle the bleed of the instrumentals.

![click discrimination](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-8.jpg)

### Step 5\. Apply the Effect

On the Effects Rack panel, click Apply at the bottom of the effect window. Your audio file's length may determine the amount of time it takes Adobe Audition to apply the effects.

![adobe audition apply effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-9.jpg)

### Step 6\. The Instrument Track Needs to be Exported

To use the music tracks on your mix or videos, export them without vocals. Go to Filе/Export/Filе to еxport a filе. Thе audio format for thе nеw music filе you can sеlеct rangеs from MP3, WAV, FLAC, AIFF and many othеrs.

For video editing software such as Premiere Pro, use a Sample Type of 48 kHz. Audio engineers who work with video media usually prefer 48 kHz sample rates.

![adobe audition click export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-10.jpg)

A Tip for Enhancing Results

To get perfect results, I recommend always listening back while you adjust these sliders, since audio quality varies from one to another.
