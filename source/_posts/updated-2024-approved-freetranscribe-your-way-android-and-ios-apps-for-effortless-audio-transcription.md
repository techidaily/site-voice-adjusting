## Part 1: What Do You Know About Background Noise?

[Background noise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is anything that disturbs the pace of the video and diverts the viewer's attention. It is the unwanted and unintended sound that takes up your audio. This may include someone chatting in the background, wind noise, and other noises. These factors decline and disrupt the clarity of audio. However, these elements can be managed through various tools and techniques to help creators.

## Part 2: How to Remove Noise from Adobe Audition: A Comprehensive Review

[Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html) is a tool tailored to assist in audio editing tasks with precision. Users can create, merge, and mix different sound effects and be creative with them. It also has seamless support of Adobe After Effects and Adobe Stock for this purpose. **Noise reduction Audition** is one of its features that helps in cleaning and enhancing audio. It clears out any unnecessary background noises from any project.

* [Noise Reduction Effect](#method1)
* [DeNoise Effect](#method2)
* [Dynamic Effect](#method3)

#### 1\. Noise Reduction Effect

In this section, we are doing a noise reduction Audition manually. The process is straightforward, and here is a step-by-step guide to it:

**Step 1:** Upon importing your audio in Adobe Audition, navigate towards the top toolbar. Select the "Effects" tab and choose "Noise Reduction/Restoration" from the dropdown menu. As the menu expands further, select “Noise Reduction.”

![look for noise reduction feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/removing-noise-with-adobe-audition-1.jpg)

#### 2\. DeNoise Effect

This is the second method of **Adobe Audition to remove noise**. Accessing this option is almost the same, but settings may vary. Here is an instruction manual on how you can denoise in Audition:

**Step 1:** Once you have imported media into the timeline, reach the upper toolbar. Look for the "Effects" tab and proceed to the "Noise Reduction/Restoration" settings. From the expansion panel, choose the "DeNoise" option.
