If you are the type of person who loves mixing audio, then you’ll need to use this little-known function in Adobe Premiere Pro. While you might know about the Audio Clip Mixer, which lets you take on the audio between clips, the Audio Track Mixer allows you to control a whole track, which can be beneficial in its own way. Sometimes you need to make big sweeping changes that affect everything, and no one wants to change their all sounds clip by clip, which is where the track mixer comes in handy.

So how do you use the audio track mixer to manage your audio inside of a video? Well keep reading and we’ll show you!

* [**Part 1: How Does the Audio Track Mixer Work**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: How to Change the Audio Track Mixer Settings**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: Using Audio Track Mixer for Your next Project**](#part3)

## Part 1: How Does the Audio Track Mixer Work

Mixing tracks is when audio is blended and mixed together in a sequence, and you have multiple sounds over one channel. For instance, when you watch a TV show and have music cut over two characters talking, that’s an example of mixed tracks. You can mix music, dialogue, sound effects, voiceovers, and other things to create a seamless finished product. You can even have different types of audio, or have different tracks play in different earphones of the headset if you want to.

![Audio Track Mixer overview](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-overview.jpg)

With audio track mixer, you can see each track being played in real time, not just on the timeline but also on its own screen. Then you can do a few things to each track such as:

* listen to tracks separately or together
* rename them
* control the volume and type of audio that each track is producing

![Audio Track Mixer details](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-detailes.jpg)

You can even look at meters while the main window is closed, which is helpful if you need to free up some space or organize your sounds while other data is shown.

You can see the sequence in real time as it is being played, see the peaks and valleys of the sound, and ensure that you can control the volume for every track. You’ll have total control over the sound, and the playback.

## Part 2: How to Change the Audio Track Mixer Settings

If you are the type of person that likes to work with the sound as it happens, then you can. Recording and mixing on the fly is easy if [you can avoid some mistakes](https://www.audio-issues.com/music-mixing/mixing-mistakes-top-ten/).

Using mono tracks allows you to alter the sound for left and right settings, while stereo tracks produce two different signals for two different speakers. So, if you want to control where the sounds are coming from, then you can do so with a simple adjustment.

![ Audio Track Mixer Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audio-track-mixer-settings.jpg)

The audio files are edited both in the audio interface and in a timeline, where it is either imported or directly recorded. Then their waveforms can be viewed, the volume and sounds can be adjusted, and [larger audio mixes can be divided into sub-mixes](https://www.izotope.com/en/blog/mixing/5-approaches-to-submixes.html).

All your changes will happen on the timeline, and you’ll be able to listen to the new track instantly.

## Part 3: Using Audio Track Mixer for Your next Project

If you are an aspiring filmmaker, working on a project, or just putting some clips and music together for fun, you need to use Audio Track Mixer to gain control over your sounds. Dealing with tracks, especially when you have several of them running on top of one another, can be a frustrating process of clicking and straining your ears to ensure that everything is just perfect.

Instead of wasting hours staring at the computer screen, using the Audio Track Mixer in Premiere Pro is a great way to cut down on the micromanagement and instead focus on what’s really important - getting a good quality sound out of your video and audio.

Use the track mixer to manage and customize your sounds, see the volume and base of each individual track in real time, and set when tracks come in and fade out. Using the mixer will allow you to have picture perfect sound quality, every single time.

## Conclusion

If you want to edit audio in an easier way, here we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is a video editor designed for people who want to enter a higher level of video editing. You can use FilmoraPro to do automatic audio sync.

### Arm your Track

Arming your track is very important. For this, head over to the Track Control Panel, and next to your track name, hit the red circle. If you have various tracks, you should solo this track and mute the other tracks.

As soon as the track is armed, a Gain Meter will activate on the side. From this, you can check if you have properly set the microphone or not. This could be tested by tapping on the microphone.

### Record

After all, the hardware settings are done, and your track is armed, it's time to start the recording. For that, just tap on the Record button in the Transport toolbar. A yellow line in the timeline will indicate the end of the recording.

![initiate audio recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-7.jpg)

To end the recording, tap on the Stop button from the Transport Toolbar. Lastly, REAPER Recording Software will ask you to save the file. In case you don't want it, you can also delete it.

### Create and Manipulate Clips

Things like manipulation get a lot easier if you split the clips in REAPER. From the items menu, you have to select the option of Split Item on Cursor. This divides your clip into two clips on each side of the cursor. You can also remove the clips by going to the Items Menu. From there, you just have to hit the Remove Item option, or else, simply press the Delete key on your keyboard.

![split your recorded audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-8.jpg)

Removing clips will create a gap in the arrangement window that can be filled by dragging forward the remaining clip.

### Volume Adjustments – Normalize

By double-clicking on the item or by selecting 'Item Properties' from a right-click, you can normalize the item. A new window will appear as Media Item Properties, from where you have to locate the Volume Settings and then select the option of Normalize.

If your item is already loud, then nothing will happen, but if it is not, then the slider will change from 0.00 dB showing an increase in the volume. Lastly, hit the 'Apply' or 'OK' button to imply the changes.

### Fade in/out

With the Media Properties, you can also adjust a Fade in and a Fade out. For this, you simply have to set an end time for the Fade in, whereas a start time is entered for Fade out. Hit the 'Ok' or 'Apply' button to apply the changes.

From the Arrangement window, fades can be adjusted. For adjusting the fades, hover with your mouse over the red line. You will see a newly shaped cursor. Just drag on the timeline to play and adjust the Fade with this new cursor.

![apply fade in and fade out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-9.jpg)

### Automate Changes

With REAPER, you can also automate changes in track parameters. We will guide about automation from Track Envelopes. From Track Control Panel, hit the Trim option. A new Envelopes window will open at this point from where you have to check the Volume box.

A new Volume Track will open up. Here, you have to set new Envelope points. That could be done by holding the shift key, right-clicking on the point, and then selecting Create New Point. A green circle will indicate the new point.

By dragging the Envelope point, you can also adjust the volume. Dragging it towards the top will increase the volume, whereas dragging it towards the bottom will eventually decrease.

![audio automate changes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-10.jpg)

### Finalize the Audio – Render

After all the above steps have been completed to set the order and adjust your desired volume, the last step comes to render your project file. For that, move to the File menu and select the 'Render' option. A window will be opened as 'Render to File.' Now, from the dropdown menu, select your desired Output Format.

Lastly, hit the Render 1 File button, and then REAPER will export your project. You can immediately listen to it by selecting the 'Launch File' option.
