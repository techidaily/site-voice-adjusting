* Open Audacity and choose "Edit" from the drop-down menu.
* Select "Preferences" from the drop-down menu.
* Look for the "File Formats" tab, & then click on the "Find Library" button to locate the appropriate library.
* Look for the file "lame enc.dll," which may be found in "C: program file same for audacity," select it, and then click the "Open" button to go further.

![preferences-for-library-resources](https://images.wondershare.com/preferences-for-library-resources.png)

Some distributions, such as the Ubuntu(Current) distribution, provide packages for Audacity, which includes mp3 encoding, and Libav, which is connected to the appropriate system libraries. It is not necessary to identify LAME or FFmpeg in the Audacity builds that have previously been packaged since there are no library choices for Audacity.

If you construct Audacity from source code, you may disable libraries' preferences by setting Audacity as follows: Disable > Dynamic > Encoding > Disable > Dynamic > Encoding > Disable > Dynamic > Encoding. Finally, create an instance of Audacity that is connected to the LAME system. Additionally, you may build FFmpeg or Libav on your own computer if you so wish.

## Can’t find MP3 Lame Library?

Most of the time, Audacity will automatically find the Lame Library. The actions outlined below are beneficial if the Lame option is available in Library preferences, & you also have a suitable version of Lame installed in a place other than the default one.

* Launch audacity and choose Edit > Preferences > Libraries from the drop-down menu on the left side of the screen.
* A Lame version number appears to the right of mp3 when it is exported from the mp3 Export Library. If LAME has been identified, you should export an mp3 and disregard the rest of the instructions. If, on the other hand, the mp3 Library displays "Not Found," go to the procedures below.
* To the right of the mp3 Library, click on the locating tab to open a search bar.
* When the "Locate Linux" dialogue box displays, pick Browse from the drop-down menu.
* A dialogue window with the text "Where is Limp3lame?" appears.
