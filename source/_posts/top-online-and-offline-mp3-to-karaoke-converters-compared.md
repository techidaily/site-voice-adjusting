## Adjusting Decibels: Fine-Tuning Sound on Audacity

Audacity is a free, open access, cross-platform sound editing and recording tool. It is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and various other operating systems. All of these aspects have contributed to Audacity's worldwide popularity. Audacity features an amplified effect that alters the loudness of your chosen audio and other practical tools that can change the sound in different ways.

As a result, Audacity can not only assist you in modifying the level of an audio file, but it can also help you equalize, reduce, normalize, and so on.

Yes, you have heard it right, **Audacity increase volume**, but the primary question is how? But don't worry, you will get the answer after reading the article. This article will explain how you can increase or decrease the volume of a whole and a specific segment of the audio file. Let's get started.

## Part 1: How to Increase or Decrease Volume Without Distortion and Clipping in Audacity

Audio clipping occurs when the audio input becomes too loud for an amplifier to produce, and the surplus signal creates distortion. When editing, you cannot add additional volume to your audio clip forever because this would result in clipping. In this case, you can use the Audacity application to emphasize your material by turning the volume up or down without distortion and clipping on a track or recording.

Learn how **Audacity increase volume without distortion** by following the procedure described below:

**Step 1:** First, download and install the Audacity software on your computer.

**Step 2:** Select the **File** from the menu above and click **Open** to open the audio file.

**Step 3:** Choose the audio track, go to the **Effect** menu and pick the **Amplify** option from the drop-down menu.

![audacity effects amplify adjust audio volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-effects-amplify-adjust-audio-volume.jpg)

**Note:** You can increase or decrease the volume by double-clicking the track and using the slider under the **Gain** title.

**Step 4:** Increase or decrease the volume by sliding the slider or typing the amplification value in the text box next to it in the Amplify window as needed.

![increase decrease audio volume audacity amplify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-decrease-audio-volume-audacity-amplify.jpg)

**Note:** Ensure that the **Allow Clipping** checkbox remains unchecked to avoid clipping. Moreover, keep in mind that increasing the volume to a greater extent can result in distortion.

Audacity is an open-source audio editing tool. It is used for various purposes, like audio recording, music creation, and audio file editing. It also allows you to increase and decrease the volume of audio files.

You may also apply the modifications to multiple files at once, rather than one at a time. Check out the instructions below to learn how to change the volume of multiple audio files:

**Step 1:** Select the **Import** option from the **File** menu, and then pick the **Audio** option. Browse to your audio files, choose all of them, and then click the Open option.

![import audio files to audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-to-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** To select all the files, press **Ctrl + A**, click on the **Effect** option in the menu bar and pick **Amplify.**

![select multiple audio files audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-multiple-audio-files-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, either enter the value in the text box next to the **Amplification Decibels** tab or use the slider under it. To verify the operation of increasing the volume, check the **allow clipping** checkbox. When you're through with the options, click the **Ok** button.

![adjust multiple audio files amplify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-multiple-audio-files-amplify.jpg)

**Step 4:** Amplification will be applied to all the tracks. Go to the File option from the above menu to export the files and then select the **Export** option.

![export amplified audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-amplified-audio-audacity.jpg)

If you’re running Audacity on macOS computer, you can watch the video tutorial below to apply effects to multiple files.

## Part 3: How to Increase Volume in Certain Parts of Track?

The audacity software also allows you to alter a specific section of an audio file. The selection tool can assist in locating a particular area of the track. After you've chosen a section of the audio file, you may utilize the amplification effect to increase its loudness. Check out the instructions below to learn how you can achieve it:

**Step 1:** Launch the Audacity software on the computer. To open the audio file, go to the **File** menu and select **Open**. You may also open the file by dragging it.

**Step 2:** Ensure that the **Selection tool** is active now. Click and hold the mouse left-click to move from one spot on the track to another.

![select part of audio file audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-part-of-audio-file-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** After picking the part, go to the **Effect** option from the menu and select **Amplify**.

![amplify part of audio files audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-part-of-audio-files-audacity.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, for that specific region, modify the amplification and click **OK**. This will only change the volume for the area you have selected.

![adjust part of audio amplification audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-part-of-audio-amplification-audacity.jpg)

## Part 4: What's the Difference between Normalize and Amplify?

Amplify and Normalize are two essential features of the Audacity tool. Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.

### **Amplify**

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

![amplify audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg)

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

![audacity normalize interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-normalize-interface.jpg)

**Related**: [Best Audio Normalizers for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.

Audacity is an open-source audio editing tool. It is used for various purposes, like audio recording, music creation, and audio file editing. It also allows you to increase and decrease the volume of audio files.

You may also apply the modifications to multiple files at once, rather than one at a time. Check out the instructions below to learn how to change the volume of multiple audio files:

**Step 1:** Select the **Import** option from the **File** menu, and then pick the **Audio** option. Browse to your audio files, choose all of them, and then click the Open option.

![import audio files to audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-to-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** To select all the files, press **Ctrl + A**, click on the **Effect** option in the menu bar and pick **Amplify.**

![select multiple audio files audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-multiple-audio-files-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, either enter the value in the text box next to the **Amplification Decibels** tab or use the slider under it. To verify the operation of increasing the volume, check the **allow clipping** checkbox. When you're through with the options, click the **Ok** button.

If you’re running Audacity on macOS computer, you can watch the video tutorial below to apply effects to multiple files.

## Part 3: How to Increase Volume in Certain Parts of Track?

The audacity software also allows you to alter a specific section of an audio file. The selection tool can assist in locating a particular area of the track. After you've chosen a section of the audio file, you may utilize the amplification effect to increase its loudness. Check out the instructions below to learn how you can achieve it:

**Step 1:** Launch the Audacity software on the computer. To open the audio file, go to the **File** menu and select **Open**. You may also open the file by dragging it.

**Step 2:** Ensure that the **Selection tool** is active now. Click and hold the mouse left-click to move from one spot on the track to another.

## Part 4: What's the Difference between Normalize and Amplify?

Amplify and Normalize are two essential features of the Audacity tool. Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.

### **Amplify**

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

![amplify audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg)

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.
