In 2012, it removed the restriction of filtered chatting and made the chat unmonitored. Letting people talk and exchange messages, images, and videos of their own choice without being restricted. But it also imposed the restriction of 13 years of age to use this platform. To avoid inappropriate messages and videos, they started using an image recognition algorithm.
