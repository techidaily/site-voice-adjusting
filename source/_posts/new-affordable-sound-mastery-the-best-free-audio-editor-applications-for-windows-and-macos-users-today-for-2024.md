Unlike Mac, Windows makes it simple to capture audio from a movie or media file running on your desktop. There seem to be two primary methods for accomplishing audacity record desktop audio in this way:

**1\. Use MME as the Audio Host**

**Step 1:** To use MME as your audio host, go to **Tracks** in the **Add New** tab in **Stereo Track** and create a new file.

**Step 4:** To record your audio source, click **Record**, then play it back.

**2\. Use WASAPI as the Audio Host**

WASAPI provides higher-resolution digital recordings. If capturing audio from an external monitor, it's also a good idea to utilize it.

**Step 1:** Convert the **Audio Host** from **MME** to **Windows WASAPI** after creating a fresh **Stereo Track**.

## Part 4: How to Set up Audacity to Record as Schedule?

A streaming video recorder or cassette can be used to arrange a recording. All of those are identical to Time Recordings in that they are used to schedule recording. The Timer record configuration dialog box may be used to set the beginning and finish of the recording. This is how you do it:

**Step 1:** By definition, the recording's **Start Date and Time** are set to the present time. It will begin recording on the present day and hour by default when you don't alter it. There is no default setting for the **End Date and Time**. You must either choose a date and time to determine the end time.

**Step 2:** There is a **Checkbox** to **Save** the work immediately. By **Ticking** the option, you may choose the path or **Folder** where the file will be saved when the recording is finished.
