## Part 1\. What are podcast directories?

A podcast directory is a listening app. It's the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.

## Part 2\. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024

Thankfully, [research conducted by EdisonResearch](https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/) shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories.

According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:

![edison podcast metrics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-1.jpg)

You must retain that Edison's research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.

Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it's all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.

### 1\. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.

Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.

![podcast directory youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-2.jpg)

Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create video-based podcasts seamlessly. You can simply convert the video podcasts into an audio format using Filmora itself and then reupload the same Podcast to even audio-based podcast directories.

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 2.5 billion active users.
* **Supported OS**: All major OS and web browsers.

### 2\. [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)

Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.

Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.

![podcast directory spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-3.jpg)

Spotify's personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily/ Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.

Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.

It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.

![podcast directory apple podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-4.jpg)

The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.

In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.

* **User Review of Apple Podcast**: "Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service."
* **Monthly User Base**: Over 28.5 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: All Apple devices.

### 4\. [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/)

Google Podcasts has over 100 million downloads on Play Store alone and is also available on the web, App Store, Blackberry, and ChromeOS users. A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.

However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.

![podcast directory google podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-5.jpg)

Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.

* **User Review of Google Podcast**

"Google Podcast includes everything that a podcast listener wants. It's simple, free, and includes valuable options like Sleep Timer, Playback speed, and more."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 30 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

### 5\. [Pandora](https://www.pandora.com/)

Pandora has over 64 million monthly active users, with a listener spending up to 24 hours/monthly on the platform. It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you're creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.

![podcast directory pandora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-6.jpg)
