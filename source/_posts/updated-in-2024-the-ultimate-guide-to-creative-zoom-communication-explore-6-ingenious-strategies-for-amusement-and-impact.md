Text2VoiceOver has a free and a paid version from which you can choose. The free version will help you create individual audio files for each piece of text you convert. But you need the paid version to create separate voice overs for each file, convert text-to-speech for 20-minute long videos and merge and edit the audio you generate.

### 6. NaturalReader Online

We have talked about the NaturalReader Software. Now, let’s tell you about [NaturalReader Online](https://www.naturalreaders.com/webapp.html). This application is slightly different from the software version. Unlike NaturalReader Software, you can use NaturalReader Online as a free voice over generator for your web pages by using it as a Chrome extension. With this app, you can also edit pronunciation and bookmark sections of your text to read later. You also get over 100 natural voices in 16 languages.

There is one free version of this free voice over generator online, but you can use it to read-only 20 minutes every day. The paid versions of NaturalReader Online are monthly subscription packs and allow you to access a complete range of features.

### 7. VoiceoverMaker.com

With [VoiceoverMaker](https://voiceovermaker.com/), you can convert your text and video files into audio in more than 100 voices and at least 33 languages. The available languages include English, Danish, Korean, Dutch, Icelandic, and Italian. You can also download all the voice-over audio you convert using this application. Another excellent feature of this software is adding pauses and whispers like a natural voice anywhere you want in the text.

This voice over generator allows you to take a free trial, but you will have to register and purchase the software for accessing all the features. They also have unique category-based voices like Animation & Gaming, Kids Stories, and Financial Services. You can go to their website and check them out for free.

### 8. TTSReader

[TTSReader](https://ttsreader.com/) is a user-friendly voice over generator that allows you to listen to your documents free of cost. You do not even need to sign in or register to use this application. You can drop the files on the website or copy and paste them in the field and TTSReader will immediately convert them to audio. It allows you to choose between different natural sounding voices and genders and adjust the speed of the voice over.

This app is a free voice over a generator that you can also use as a Chrome extension to convert the text on websites to audio. It remembers where you stopped reading and automatically bookmarks it for you. This way, you can resume reading from where you paused when you come back.

TTSReader also has an app to download on your Android and iOS phones. However, if you want to download the audio you converted from your text files, you can only do that on Windows devices.

### Final Thoughts

As you can see, you can choose from the many free voice over generators online. Most software applications have free and paid versions, from which you can choose according to your convenience. Whether you are a YouTube content creator needing an explanatory voice-over or a disabled person searching for a user-friendly text-to-speech convertor, these apps will quickly help you achieve your text to audio transformation goals.
