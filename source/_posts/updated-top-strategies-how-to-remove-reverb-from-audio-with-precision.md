## Part 1\. Understanding Reverb: An Overview

### What is reverb

Podcasting and music production commonly use reverb as a signal processing tool. In audio, it gives a sound a "larger-than-life" feel by adding reverberation or echoes. Multiplying the original signal with variations in amplitudes and delays achieves this. In addition to bringing life to a track, this creates a unique effect. "Echo" is also a term used in colloquial language.

Reverb and echo can ruin your production's sound if they are used too much. Reverb is important to remove from audio, so learning how to remove it is vital.

### How does reverb happen, and why can it be a bit of a problem?

Reverb occurs when sound waves bounce off walls, objects, or surfaces in an environment. Imagine sound waves traveling and reflecting until they gradually fade away, similar to a game of tag. Audio production can benefit and suffer from this natural phenomenon.

Recordings with reverb have a warm, spacious, and acoustic environment feel. Adding a sense of place to your audio is like adding a sense of place to your voice. A sonic mess can be created by too much reverb at the wrong places. You may have difficulty hearing the essential elements of your audio.

Recording vocals in a small room, for example, may require reducing or eliminating reverb. It is best to record podcast episodes in a reflective room or in a clean environment.

### 5\. [AudioSlicer for Mac](http://audioslicer.sourceforge.net/)

AudioSlicer is a Cocoa GUI app for Mac OS X. It's designed to find all the silences in an MP3 file. It also allows you to split the audio file and tag them properly. While there are other audio splitter Mac apps that can do the tasks automatically according to specific criteria, AudioSlicer displays the silences within the specified duration. It allows you to listen to the audio before and after the silence. Then you can decide if you want to do the split at that point. Splitting of the file is done without any loss to the quality because there is no decoding or re-encoding of the audio file during the process. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 and above and supports both Intel Macs and PowerPC.
