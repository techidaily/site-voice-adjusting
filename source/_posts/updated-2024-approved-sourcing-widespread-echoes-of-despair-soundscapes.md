* [**Part 2\. Separate Audio from Video on Mac with the Best Alternative to iMovie**](#part2)

## Part 1\. How to Separate/Detach/Split Audio from Video in iMovie on Mac

The iMovie program is capable of producing high-quality movies and videos. If you're dealing with a video that includes both sound and pictures, you may want to split the two at some point.

To separate audio from video in iMovie on Mac, just open the video and follow the steps below.

#### Step 1\. Remove the audio clip from the video

In your iMovie timeline, find the clip that contains both video and audio.

Right-click the clip or hold **Control** and click it. You can also go to the menu bar and choose **Detach Audio**.

The audio from that clip will then show as its own "clip" in green below the video. The little line on the left, however, confirms that the video and audio are still connected. This implies that if you delete the video, you'll lose the audio as well. As a result, you'll either need to move the audio clip somewhere else in your video or place it in the Background Music Well at the bottom of the timeline.

Simply select, drag, and drop the green audio clip where you want it. It will be in the background of all other noises in your movie if you set it in the Background Music Well.

#### Step 2\. Get rid of the video

You can remove the video by clicking it and utilizing one of these techniques after you disconnect the audio and unlink it from the video.

Select **Delete** from the shortcut menu by right-clicking.

Only in the project timeline, not in the event pane, can you disconnect audio from a clip.

#### 6\. In iMovie for Mac, how can I mute a video?

Click the **Create New** button in iMovie to start a new project. From the resulting dropdown menu, pick **Movie**. Select the video you wish to mute by clicking the **Import Media** option. Drag and drop the video onto the timeline once it's been imported. Right-click on the video in the timeline and choose **Detach Audio** from the dropdown menu.

The audio and video will be separated or detached as a result of this. Remove the audio from the video that you separated or disconnected in the previous step. The audio file (or layer) is located just beneath the video file on your timeline. Then you can either delete it by right-clicking on it and selecting **Delete** from the dropdown menu, or by simply clicking on it. It will be highlighted in yellow to indicate that it has been selected. And then press the delete key.

#### 7\. How do I view and download a preview?

By clicking the play button next to the **Share** button, you may see a preview of the video. The video can then be downloaded to your computer by selecting **Download Video** from the dropdown menu after hitting the **Publish** button.

Alternatively, you can share it directly from the app to other social media platforms. Apart from removing audio from videos, Animaker also includes other video editing tools that you'll need to modify your videos for social media and your website.

## Wrap Up

As seen in this instructional article, iMovie has countless amazing features as a [video editor on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Separating audio from a video is one of those interesting features on iMovie.

If a video has music, sounds, or voices that you'd like to separate from the video, following the above-listed steps is an easy way to do just that. One thing to always remember is to keep the app open while exporting.

And if iMovie can’t meet your need, don’t worry. Wondershare Filmora can be your better choice.
