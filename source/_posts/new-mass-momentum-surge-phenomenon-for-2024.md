Google uses the latest technologies to provide you the customized voices for your brand to stand out from the crowd and make your videos and other content unique and different from others. Google incorporates DeepMind's speech synthesis to provide you with the best and most accurate results. The voice generated by Google can't be differentiated because it sounds like a natural and human-like voice. But the thing that makes it less attractive is its pricing. Unlike Siri for Mac, Google charges its user for using its Text-to-voice service on the basis of characters. But all the astounding features and natural voices of Google text-to-speech makes it worth every penny you spend on it. Google has two packages to be availed, Standard and WaveNet. The WaveNet package contains the voices that are used by Google in its products and service such as Google Search, Google Assistance, and Google Translate.

Step4 When the editor program opens, tap on the drop-down menu below the top-most toolbar for Record. From the options, select the "Record a Voiceover" choice.

Step5 The recording pop-up window will open. Click on the big red record button after the input microphone/speaker settings, and start speaking. When you are done, click the square red stop button. Press OK to save.

Alternatively, you can click on the Microphone icon. Please wait 3 seconds and then start speaking into the microphone and click it again after you are done speaking. The newly recorded file will automatically come in the audio track timeline.

Step6 Click the audio track in the timeline. Among the settings, make changes as you prefer in Pitch, Volume, and Speed. Cut the sections of your voiceover recording you want to remove and add fade-in/fade-out effects. After making all changes, click OK.

![after making changes click ok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/change-audio-track-settings.jpg)

Step7 If you have the recording of the narration already available in other locations, like your phone or device, import it into the software.

Step8 Add transitions, effects, and titles from the respective tabs on the top toolbar.

![add titles from the title tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/add-titles.jpg)

Step9 To add sound effects, go to Media and acquire the new audio clip or effect to add. Go to Effects > choose Audio Effects. Download the sound effect you want to insert and drag it onto the clip in the timeline.

![choose audio effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/choose-audio-effects.jpg)

Step10 Choose sound effects like Echo, Small Room, Big Rooms, Lobby, etc. Download and drag the sound effect to the clip or press the Add icon. Play a preview to see how it worked.

Step11 After completing all the edits, click on the Export button at the top. In the next window, choose the file format and additional customizations through Settings. After everything is done, press the Export button to save offline.
