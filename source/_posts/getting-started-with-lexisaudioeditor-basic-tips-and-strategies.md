We often love to record soundtracks as well as videos at home and want to share them with friends but it is not always possible to record these tracks with good quality. Sometimes the background music is very noisy or it has an unwanted part, we may want to remove that unwanted noise from recorded tracks to make the audio quality better, and we can also add more audio effects to polish the whole editing.
