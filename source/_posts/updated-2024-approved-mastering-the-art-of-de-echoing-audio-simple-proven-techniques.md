If someone detects such a kind of modification or violation of copyright policy, you may face some strict actions too. According to the YouTube Library rules, you can modify or use a copyrighted audio file by taking permission from the copyright holder only. In case you do something without having permission, it will be considered an illegal act and a violation of platform policy. The copyright holder can also take action as he or she wants. It will be good if you choose the files that are available with YouTube audio library free download options only.

This is a next-level audio video mixer that we find to be an excellent option for mixing, recording, editing, and restoring files. This mixing software allows you easily record music or podcast for various platforms. In addition, it offers a sharing feature that will enable you to share directly from the platform. Adobe Audition provides two mixing modes: the waveform view and the multitrack view.
