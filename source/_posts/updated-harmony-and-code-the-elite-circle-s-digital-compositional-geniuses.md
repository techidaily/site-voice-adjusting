Robots can’t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, let’s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

| [1 - Amper Music](#1)  | [2 - AIVA](#2)         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [3 - Jukedeck](#3)     | [4 - Ecrett Music](#4) |
| [5 - Melodrive](#5)    | [6 - ORB Composer](#6) |
| [7 - Amadeus Code](#7) | [8 - Humtap](#8)       |
| [9 - Muzeek](#9)       | [10 - Brain.fm](#10)   |

Creative professionals don't have to worry about the workability of online websites as they can be navigated by beginners easily. Let us have a look at each of them!

### 1\. [AShamaluevMusic](https://www.ashamaluevmusic.com/instruments)

### Conclusion

The great selection of music is the essence of the video. Don't you agree? The instrumental background music has no vocals, but it gives a calming environment for the video content to get the desired attention. The message is lost if both music and content are expressive with full of lyrics.

Therefore, the article discussed important tips to choose MP3 instrumental music for the videos. The platforms to download copyright-free instrumental music were also explained extensively. Furthermore, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be used for video editing and adding instrumental music to the video.
