## "15 Free Music Pieces Recommended for Crafting Memorable Video Narratives"

The popularity of montages is increasing every day, as they allow you to use fewer words and express more. Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer's attention and communicate your message. We'll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.

## What Is Copyright?

If you are wondering: What is copyright? It's a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.

Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.

If you're caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you'll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone's intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.

Claiming you didn't know about the artist's copyrighted material doesn't excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.

If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist's consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.

The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.

For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.

### 7. [3D Lyrics](https://elements.envato.com/kinetic-typography-3d-lyrics-two-ae-projects-VDPC5G6)

The 3D lyrics video template is one of its kind as it contains two projects under one model.

The first version is straightforward where you get to learn the steps like

* how to edit texts
* how to add images/music/logo
* how to use controls
* how to render video in any resolution and fps

and quickly get started even by any amateur after effect user.

But, the second version is a little complicated. It is a detailed version of the first one where you learn how a project is organized and how you should customize it.

It also has tips on how to create previews during customization in the least possible time.

You need to arrange the scenes you wish to use in final composition, import the audio, and edit the first, second, and third scene’s text.

It allows you to change the background color, adjust controls like extrusion quality, etc. and ten other adjustment layers. Finally, render the video at a particular frame rate and resolution.
