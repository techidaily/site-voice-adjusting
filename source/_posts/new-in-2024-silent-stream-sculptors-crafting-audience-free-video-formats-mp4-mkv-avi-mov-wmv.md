**Choose co-host (optional)**

You can pick up a co-host if you want. A Co-Host will further help you get the conversation going smoothly and quickly. It will also look engaging to the listeners. Overall, it is better to pick up a co-host to change your decision, later on, to continue the conversation individually.

**Select the format, style, and length of the podcast**

After planning the content, you can select the length, style, and format of the podcast. Even if you want to go for a long-duration podcast, make it easy and straightforward to understand to avoid distracting the audience’s attention. You can then choose among the most popular podcast formats, namely the Interview Shows, Educational Shows, Conversational Podcasts, Solo-Casts, True Stories podcasts, or Podcast Theatre narrating fictional stories.

It will also offer a preview of the background hustle, which further looks attractive and engaging to the listener.

## How to Record a Podcast on the iPhone?

Garage Band is the ideal option if you want to know how to record a podcast on your iPhone. It is the best DAW to be used on a Macbook or iMac version. Given below are steps on how to record a podcast with Garage Band.

Step 2: Start recording

Select from either a single track or multi-track recording in Garage Band. However, the single-track recording setup for a solo host is at default. To set a multi-track recording, go to Track> Configure Track Header and tick the box Record Enable to have it in each Track.

Step 3: Edit

Now, you can trim, split regions, and automate the podcast audio. Go to Mix> Show Automation to apply volume automation. The Split Regions at Playhead tool is another essential editing feature in the Garage Band. It will split the selected region into individual regions to move and trim etc. You can also use royalty-free music tracks of Garage Band while editing the podcast.

Step 4: Audio Mixing

First of all, arrange all the clips to use its inbuilt audio mixing feature. Then, you can set EQ and Compression, etc., for sound mixing. To mix your tracks effectively, use the podcast's original audio level as a baseline and then arranged for things like sound effects and music, etc.
