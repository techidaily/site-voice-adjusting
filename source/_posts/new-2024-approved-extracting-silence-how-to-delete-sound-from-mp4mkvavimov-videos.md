## Part 1\. A Quick Verdict of Sound Forge

Sound Forge is one of the best software for professionals, beginners, and enthusiasts due to its simple and essential restoration tools that can help remove unnecessary background noises. However, this music software can remove 70% of the noise, leaving some cracks and pops, but still, users get a lot of improvement in the audio quality.

You can record and extract audio from video files. The customizable toolbars, interfaces, and a wide variety of presets give you a complete audio editing experience with Sound Forge.

The only drawback is that the software cannot handle multiple audio files and plugin effects together in the free version, making it useless for batch processing. However, you can get these features in the paid version.
