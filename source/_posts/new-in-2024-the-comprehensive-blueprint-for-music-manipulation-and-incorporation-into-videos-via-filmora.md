![ Anime voice changer  premiere  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-anime-voice-with-premiere-pro.jpg)

Firstly, the audio recording needs to be uploaded to Adobe Premiere Pro. We can also directly record the audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.

Besides the Pitch Shifter feature in Premiere Pro, you can also use the equalizer to adjust the voice too. With an equalizer, you can give nasal effects to your audio.

![advanced%20video%20cutter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/advanced%20video%20cutter.png)

## Section 1. How to mute the audio on the video

Part1\. [Steps to cut the audio from videos on Mac](#cut-audi-on-mac)

Part2\. [Steps to cut the audio from videos on iPhone](#cut-audio-on-iphone)

### Steps to cut the audio from videos on Mac

If you are using a Mac for editing, knowing that [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the best way to go about it is good but knowing how to navigate is key. Not to worry, the steps you need to get started are all listed in these three steps.

Step 1: Import Video to Filmora

Import the video to your Filmora. You can also directly drag the video into the Filmora interface.

![1index introduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/1.index-introduction.jpg)

Step 2: Mute the audio

After dragging the video to the timeline, right-click the stand-alone video, choose "mute".

Step 3: Save your edit

Click the "export" button on the interface and select the desired video format

![export to format mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/export-to-format-mac.JPG)

### Steps to cut the audio from videos on iPhone

If you want to do the mute on an iPhone, you will need to also follow some steps to get it done on your iMovie.

### Step 1: Open the iMovie

Opening the iMovie app goes beyond just clicking it to open, you also have to follow up this process by clicking the continue button that pops up. If the app has opened and you can see an inviting interface, move to the next step.

### Step 2: Select a video you want

There are different pages on the interface but your concern is on the project page. On that page, click on the plus sign button as it directs you to start or input a new video. After clicking on the plus sign, it will bring up movies that you would further select.

 ![new project on imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/new-project-on-imovie.jpg)

Don't hesitate to select the movie you want to edit. Complete the process by clicking the "create movie" button beneath the gallery of movies.

### Step 3: Mute the audio

Muting the audio becomes straightforward when you have moved it to the interface. In this step, click on the video clip button as seen in the picture then mute it by selecting the mute option (the picture below shows the mute sign at the lower-left corner) from the audio button. When this is done, your video has been silenced.

 ![mute audio imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/mute-audio-imovie.jpg)

Don't forget to save it when you are done editing by clicking on the "done button" that is visible at the left corner positioned at the top of the screen.

## Section 2. Requirements to extract the music of the video and save

There are some times when you just want to extract the audio leaving out the video. Maybe the song accompanying the video is excellent but the video quality is bad, or maybe the video is not as great as the song. Whatever the reason may be, you can extract the music of your video and save it using. The two best apps to do this are Filmora and MP3 Converter -Audio Extractor. Below are the steps to extract audio using Filmora

Step1\. import the video into the Filmora

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/1.index-introduction.jpg)

Another way to import a video is to drag and drop the video into the program. Using any of these two steps allows your video to be listed in the media library

Step 2 Next, right-click the video and choose "Audio Detach." After some time, the video and audio will load as two separate files.

 ![mac audio detach1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/mac-audio-detach1.jpg)

You can choose to delete the video or keep it. If you want to delete it, simply right-click and choose delete. This will remove the video entirely.

Step 3\. Edit the extracted audio by doubling clicking on it. When you do, the audio editing tools would be displayed. You can adjust the music volume, change voice, and do other edits.

![8audio balance](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/8.audio-balance.jpg)

Step 4\. If the audio has some sounds you would like to take out, place your cursor at the exact place you want the deletion to start. Next, press the split button. This step can be used to delete any aspect of the music sound you don't like.
