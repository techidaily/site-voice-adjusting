_How to add a .mka audio track to a .mkv video? Is there a simple step-by-step? I tried Mkvmerge but it doesn't seem to work with this._

 You may come across the same problem: want to add audio to MKV but find video editing tools like Mkvmerge doesn’t work. Well, then what’s the available way to do so? In this article, I’ll show you how to add audio to MKV file by using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). If you are looking for such a solution, just feel free to see the guide below. This program enables you to add specified audio track to MKV as well as apply more effects to your source file.

#### 1 Add video and audio files

 Download and install Wondershare Filmora first. Once run it, click the “Import” button to load both the video and audio files. You can also directly drag and drop the media files to the program.

![remove audio from mkv](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Add audio to MKV

 Now what you have to do is to drop the video file to the Video track in the Timeline and audio to the Audio Track. Then you can make the audio file fit your video by trimming or double click the audio file to set fade in/out effects, speed up or slow down it, adjust volume so that it doesn't drown out the original audio of your video, etc. If you want to remove the original audio, just right click the video in Timeline and select “Audio Detach” and press “Delete” to remove audio from video.

 Besides adding an audio file, you can also use Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) to record and add your own voiceover. To do this, simply click the “Record” button on the toolbar and record the voiceover in the Record Audio window. Click the red button to get started and “OK” to save it and return to the main interface. The recorded voiceover will then appear in the audio track. Then adjust its position, volume, etc., just like any audio files.

#### 3 Export the new MKV file

 After adding audio, click “Play” to preview and listen to the new file. Then click “Create” to export your MKV file. Here are various choices for you: export the video to various video formats, convert the video to play on different mobile devices, upload the video to YouTube instantly or burn video to DVD disc. Select a desired output way and hit “Create” to start exporting the video file with the added audio.

## Top 4 Best Music Editor Applications for Mac

A good music editor for your Mac can do everything you need: record voiceover files, cut, delete, insert audio clips, add voice effects, add sound effects, perform a spectrographic analysis, and much more. And why do you need to do those things with a music editor? Some of the most common music editor projects include:

* Find music online and edit to share to phone and other devices
* Trim audio and music files
* Create custom ringtones
* Create and share custom music and audio files
* Add music and sound effects to video files

So how do you choose a music editor for Mac that can do everything you want? In this article, we will share with you some music editors that you can use on Mac computer. Let's move on.

## Section 1\. Free Music Editors for Mac

Free-to-use is great, especially when you get all the performance and features you need in a music editor. Two free music and audio editors for Mac we recommend are:

### 1\. Audio Editor: [OcenAudio](https://www.ocenaudio.com/)

**OcenAudio** has a very extensive toolkit of audio editing capabilities and tools. Still, one of its best features is that it's easy on your memory: you can edit even very large files without requiring external memory resources.

OcenAudio supports MP3, WAV, FLAC, WMA, and many other audio formats.

![ocenaudio ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ocenaudio.jpg)

### 2\. MP3 Editor: [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/)

**Audacity** is free and also has to go for it, a simple and intuitive interface that is easy for beginners. It also has a surprisingly extensive list of features, options, and effects, including spectrographic analysis, undo/redo function, and more.

Audacity supports many formats, including WAV, AIFF, FLAC, MP2, MP3, and OGG.

![Audacity ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity.jpg)

## Section 2\. Professional Quality Music Editors for Mac

Pay music editing programs for Mac offer a serious boost in performance and an increased number of supported formats and output options.

Two pay music and audio editors for Mac we recommend are:

### 3\. Music Editor: Wondershare Filmora Video & Audio Editor for Mac \[Free\]

[Wondershare Filmora Video & Audio Editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is often aimed at users who want to edit videos, but this program also offers professional quality performance for editing music and audio. Novice users will appreciate the price and the intuitive interface that allows a gentle learning curve.

Advanced users will like the extensive features and supported formats, including a music library feature. It has slightly fewer features and supported formats than Adobe Audition, but if you don't need those extra bells and whistles, this is the music editor for Mac for you.

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

### 4\. Sound Editor: [Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

**Adobe Audition** comes with a high price at $20/mo. However, users who demand the best will find the cost worth it for a license. It has the most extensive audio and music editing toolset, and it supports the widest range of formats.

A complete range of tutorials also supports adobe Audition to help you get the most from your investment. The fact it takes a while to work through the tutorials and get up to speed might be the only drawback.

## Section 3\. How to choose Music Editor for Mac users?

Choosing a music editor for Mac, including the ability to edit and output to MP3 and MP4 formats, depends entirely on your needs. If your needs are modest and limited features or functionality work for you, several free-to-use options will get the job done. If you need more robust functionality and professional quality, a pay program will offer more satisfying performance. Keep in mind the following questions when making your choice:

* How often do I need to edit music and audio?
* Do I need simple trim and edit features, or also audio effects?
* What formats are my source files, and what formats do I want to output to?
* What is my budget, and how can I balance performance and price?

With Filmora, you can edit music and audio files with ease. Besides basic cutting features, you can apply fade-in and fade-out effects, adjust the audio volume. What's more, you can remove the background noise in the audio to get a clear sound.
