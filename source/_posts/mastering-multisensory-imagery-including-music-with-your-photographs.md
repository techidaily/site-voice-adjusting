On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today's industry.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)
