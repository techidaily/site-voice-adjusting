### Step 2: Add a new audio file to the video

![add audio to video free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-drag-music.JPG)

### Step 3: Record and add your voiceover to video

Instead of [adding music to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can also record and add voiceover to the video. It's a fun way to add narration or complementary audio to video. To do so, click the Record button on the toolbar above timeline, the Record dialog will appear.

Click the red Record button, and you can start to talk in 3 seconds. The voiceover will be added to the User's Album and timeline when completed.

### Step 4: Replace audio track of the video

To do so, right-click the video you want to replace audio in it, and select [Audio Detach](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). After that, delete the audio file from the track.

As described above, you can then drag and drop a new audio file from User's Album to the Audio track.
