There are times when you need to split audio files with the use of your Mac. The fastest and best way to do the task is with the use of an audio splitter for Mac. There are lots of programs made to split audio tracks. If you are looking for the best free apps for the Mac, then you are on the right page. Below are the top audio splitters for Mac users.

## Part 1\. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Although widely known as the best video editing software for beginners, Wondershare Filmora [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) also serves as a great audio editing tool. It can split, trim, fade-in or out, change the speed of your audio files, etc.

One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create. It is almost impossible to add both two audio tracks to a video at the same time. However, by using Filmora, you will be able to add up to 3 audio tracks at a time. That means your voiceover, background music, even some funny or emotional sound effects can be added to a video clip simultaneously with one click of the button.
