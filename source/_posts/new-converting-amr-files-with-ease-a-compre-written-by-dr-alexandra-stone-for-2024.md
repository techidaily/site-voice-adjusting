The structure of AMR allows the creation of a group of 160 twenty millisecond long samples by the codec in one frame. The multi-rate codec available for normal AMR files include ACELP, DTX, CAD and CNG.

An equalizer is basically an audio filter or profile that has a certain setting for the frequencies of sound so that the music you are playing on your device sounds as good as originally recorded.

Whether you listen to music on your smartphone or your computer through speakers or headphones, an equalizer app is a necessity especially if you are an audiophile.
