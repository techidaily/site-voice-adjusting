Other features include;

* Feedback Control for the level of granulated signals
* A wide selection of popular window shapes

### 8\. [Step Machine](https://www.rozzer.net/2006/02/09/step-machine-midi-step-sequencer/)

Step machine is in the style of the step sequencer, although it is a midi loop sequencer. But to use it, you need to support midi output from the VST plugins. It offers control of the velocity, loop, pitch, octave, gate, and slide through each step as the host plays. A very detailed plugin for those looking for a professional touch. Other features include:

* Two assignable midi CC sequencer
* Features a complex randomize function and a force to scale function
* A comfortable and fully functional interface

Other features;

* 100 presets, all ready for you to choose from
* Shallow GPU consumption
