#### Step 2: Change Voice by Changing Pitch Option

Both video/audio files and voiceover on the Timeline have the Pitch option. You could easily change the voice of video or reca orded voiceover through it. Just drag the little triangle button to the desired position. The value will vary from -12 to 12.
