There are different music mixers, but finding one compatible with Mac can be difficult. Luckily for you, we know precisely where to look.

So, whether you want to knock together an excelling MP3 mix or you’re looking to make impressive music, check out the list below for the ideal MP3 music mixer for you.

1. [How to Mix Audio Video Tracks with Wondershare Filmora](#part6-1)

## Audacity

![audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-1.jpg)

The first free MP3 music mixer for Mac that we have to consider is Audacity. Audacity is hard to miss because of how easy it is to use. Therefore, many people tend to recommend this software. Audacity is an open-sourced MP3 music mixer that’s entirely free to use. It has a straightforward and interactive user interface that supports the most popular file types, including MP3, WAV, OGG, MIDI, and many more.

With Audacity, you can record right in the app or edit existing files as you miss. It also comes with many effects that you can utilize to improve your MP3 file. Another unique tool on Audacity is the spectrogram that allows you to analyze the audio frequencies. Audacity supports up to 32-bit audio files making it a powerful MP3 music mixer for Mac users.

This MP3 music mixer is ideal for beginners as its features are easy to navigate. However, this doesn’t mean that professional DJs and sound producers cannot also utilize this audio mixer. You can record audio to add to your MP3 using a mixer or a live microphone. It also lets you download digital recordings from social media platforms like YouTube. This free MP3 music mixer for Mac is a great option to explore.

 Pros

* It offers a spectrogram view to visualize frequencies
* It offers effects like Audio unity, which is specifically for Mac only
* Allows you to delete, cut, and merge clips
* It is entirely free to use
* Its keyboard shortcuts allow for a smooth workflow

 Cons

* Crashes tend to happen
* It doesn’t support non-destructive editing

## WavePad

![wavepad](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-2.jpg)

This is another impressive Mac MP3 music mixer you can use for free if you’re doing non-commercial mixing. WavePad is remarkable because it supports many file types, so there’s no need to convert your MP3 to another format before mixing on WavePad. It also supports users working on multiple files simultaneously. This means you can process thousands of files at the same time while editing a file. In addition, WavePad offers a vast range of effects and supports audio bookmarking, which you would find very useful.

Other features these mixer offers are voice manipulation and text-to-speech functions. It is quite easy to use, making it an excellent option for beginners. Some of the effects people seem to love on this MP3 music mixer is the compression, noise removal, reverb, and many more. There’s also the analysis tool that advanced users can utilize to mix and edit their MP3 files.

With WavePad, speed and pitch changes are entirely possible. It also supports audio scrubbing, which is very handy. However, this file doesn’t support multi-tracking. Therefore, users can edit stereo or mono audio files on the software. Although its multi-window interface can take a while to get used to, this Mac MP3 music mixer is worth a try.

 Pros

* It is free for non-commercial use
* It comes with many impressive features
