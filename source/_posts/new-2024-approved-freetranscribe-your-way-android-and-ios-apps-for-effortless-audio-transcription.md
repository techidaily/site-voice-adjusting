### Split Audio after Detaching from Video

As we have mentioned, sometimes you like a sound, but it is part of a video. Do you know a way to get that audio from a video? Well, yes, with Filmora, you can get your favorite audio even from videos and then split it.

This could be done by using its ‘Detach Audio from Video’ feature. What this feature does is that it separates the audio from video and displays both the files separately on the timeline. You can delete the video file by selecting it and pressing 'Delete.' Whereas, by following the above-mentioned steps, you can then split the audio easily with the Filmora MP3 splitter.
