## Unraveling the Podcast Puzzle: A Step-by-Step Approach to Download, Store, and Manage Auditory Media on Computers

Listening to Podcasts is a great way to gather information. Name a topic, and you will find a Podcast on it. You can always count on the best Podcast shows to get quality knowledge.

You can listen to those Podcasts online. But, sometimes, users want to download the Podcast. The reason can be anything; you might want to listen offline. There are various ways to get the job done. We will walk you through different methods to download Podcasts to the computer.

## Can you download a Podcast as a file?

Yes, it's possible. But the process is a bit different for many platforms.

If you're downloading Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify and Apple Play. These apps will save your Podcast in the app's library and make it available for offline listening.

Yet, you can't get access to the saved Podcast on the PC. For this, you need third-party tools to download them to your computer. A step-by-step process of using apps and tools is given below!

But if you're downloading a Podcast from a video platform like YouTube, then yes. You can download it as a file. Here are a few methods to download podcasts. Let's walk you through them one by one.

## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps

You can save Podcasts to your computer from Podcast manager apps. Various Podcast manager apps, such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Podcast, and many others, allow such an operation. However, it is important to note that some podcast managers require a premium subscription to be able to download podcasts.

For example, if you're using a Windows computer, you can use iTunes to download Podcasts. While Mac users can use Apple Podcasts. The steps below allow you to save Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify;

Step1 Install the Spotify app on your PC or Mac.

Step2 Open the Spotify app and login to your account.

Step3 Locate the Podcast show you wish to download.

Step4 Move your cursor over the Podcast episodes and click the download button to download them to your computer.

The backward of using Podcast manager apps is that it can only save your Podcast in the manager app. If you uninstall the app accidentally, you lose access to the saved Podcast because it won't be available on your PC.

To cope with this problem, we provide third-party apps to directly download the Podcast to your computer from the manager apps.

* **Removes Vocals from Audio in One Click** – Easily dub any video without covering the current vocals, which allows you to keep great soundtracks after removing the vocals.
* **Effective Vocal Separation** – With the use of advanced AI algorithms, the AI Vocal Remover isolates vocals with exceptional quality to ensure that the vocals are effectively separated from background music. It does all this without losing audio fidelity.
* **Instant Listening of Results** – You won’t have to export or download the entire video or audio to listen to the results. Filmora allows you to view and listen to the results in the editor on the go.
* **Removes other Audio Elements** – Aside from extracting acapella and removing vocals, Filmora allows you to extract other elements from your audio. Point out the unwanted elements to remove from your soundtrack to achieve better results.
* **Dub Exceptional Videos** – No need to record vocals in different languages and stick them over the original ones. The AI Vocal Remover feature allows you to completely remove the originals so you can import new and fresh ones. This will give you highly professional and clear dubbed videos in a matter of clicks.
