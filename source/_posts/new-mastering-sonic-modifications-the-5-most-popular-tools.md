Video editing can be a fun task, but it can also be frustrating and challenging. Adding finishing touches to make it appear better will surely require knowledge and expertise. More than just [adding special effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), another thing that you might want to do is to mute video in specific parts, such as when there is crappy noise.

There are many instances wherein you will find it practical to mute some parts of the video you are editing. One of the reasons to mute it is when there is crappy noise in the background.

Any distracting or broken sound in the background should be removed so as not to affect the overall quality of the footage negatively.

If you plan to embed [background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), muting the audio will also be beneficial.
