### News Intro

The intro to your news channel or program must be engaging and attractive. It should be 3 to 5 seconds long and should cover the important details of the show.

### Background of the News

Moving on, the next important thing to consider is the reporter's background. Most expert and established news broadcaster channels use chroma key to create the magic. In this way, the background color can be changed easily and flawlessly. Most news anchors prefer green background.
