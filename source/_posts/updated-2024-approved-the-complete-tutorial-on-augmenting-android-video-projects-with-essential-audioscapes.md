Smartphone manufacturers are always trying to find ways to improve the cameras on their Android to make them the best ones on the market. Now there are applications that are starting to find their way onto the Android market so users can edit these videos and photos taken by their phones, turning their phones into so much more than they ever thought possible. With all of these choices on the market, it can be difficult to choose which ones are the best options. This is especially true if you are looking for options that can add **audio and voice overs to your videos**.

---

Despite adding audio files to your videos on mobile device, we suggest you try the desktop video editing tool, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), to do the task. This desktop software supports almost any audio format. And it allows you to trim, cut, fade in or fade out the audio. Besides, there are so many hand picked effects available, such like Audio Mixer and Audio Equalizer for make your videos better.

## Applications for Adding Audio to Video in Android

#### 1\. [Filmora for Android](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

One of the highest recommended applications is [Filmora for Android](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This application is especially perfect for those who are looking for an app that can not only deliver some amazing results but is also very easy to use.

This application has most of the editing features you would need from a PC editor. Basic editing functionalities such as trimming, merging, duplicating, adding audio or voice overs, music to video etc are all available in this excellent Android video editor. Other than that, you will get dozens of video effects from this app, things like video overlays, filters, animated text effects, sound effects are all free. One most appealing feature of this app is the themes, with which you can spice your video up by applying any of its built-in video themes. Video editing can’t just be easier. Exporting video is also a breeze, you can either save your final video to the Android device, or directly upload them to any of those popular social media networks such as Youtube, Vimeo, Facebook and more! Check out the video below to get a quick overview of this app:

Most important of all, it’s totally free without any limitations or watermarks. Download a free version below:

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

#### 2\. [KineMaster Pro](http://www.kinemaster.com/)

![add audio to android video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-pro.jpg)

If you are looking for an editing application with a bit more substance to it, than KineMaster Pro is your best option. There is a lot more substance found in this application that you may not be able to find elsewhere. Not only is the end product amazing, but it has a very well-designed user interface. The UI has a drag and drop interface that is really easy to use. You can adjust the video so that you get an amazing quality picture on your video, as well as offering a variety of templates so that you can really get a great video. One of the greatest features is that this app can support multiple audio tracks and allows the user to overlap these tracks. You can also include voiceover tracks as well. One downside to this app is that it is only available for certain Android phones. If your phone is not one of the supported devices, you will not be able to see it in the Google Play Store. You can get this for free, but it will watermark your videos if you do not have the pro version.

#### 3\. [Video Maker Pro Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yong.app.videoeditor&hl=en)

![how to add audio to video on android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-maker-pro-free.jpg)

This is a bare-bones application that is very reminiscent of the original Google Movie Studio app. There is no real ability for any in-depth video editing in this app, which is one of its downsides. It can support a single track, but it is unable to support more layers than that. You can choose between a music track or a voiceover track but not both. It is easy to use and free with ads. This is a good option if you just want something basic and no-frills to mess around with.

#### 4\. [](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goseet.VidTrim&hl=en)VidTrim

![application for adding audio to video android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidtrim-android.jpg)

This application is less for actual editing but can be very useful if you are merely looking to manipulate videos. It is very easy to use, but there are limited features to this application which may not be what you are looking for. You are able to add audio tracks to the video but as a result of the limited editing features, you cannot place them in any particular spot. There is a free and a pro version that does not have ads. If you want something very basic and easy to use, this is a great choice.

#### 5\. [](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wevideo-video-editor-and/okgjbfikepgflmlelgfgecmgjnmnmnnb?hl=en) WeVideo

![add audio to video android application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-for-android.jpg)

This is not an app for people who want some serious video editing abilities. This application is more specialized for those people who want to share the videos on their social media accounts. It is a cloud-based application with a long process time that users may be annoyed with. There are very limited features available with this application. You can add in one of their ready-to-use songs for your videos but this will create a theme that will dictate how the rest of the video looks. Essentially, there really is little customization you can get with this. There is a free version, which does watermark the video, or a premium option that comes with a monthly fee.

This is not an app for people who want some serious video editing abilities. This application is more specialized for those people who want to share the videos on their social media accounts. It is a cloud-based application with a long process time that users may be annoyed with. There are very limited features available with this application. You can add in one of their ready-to-use songs for your videos but this will create a theme that will dictate how the rest of the video looks. Essentially, there really is little customization you can get with this. There is a free version, which does watermark the video, or a premium option that comes with a monthly fee.

## Audacity

![audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-1.jpg)

The first free MP3 music mixer for Mac that we have to consider is Audacity. Audacity is hard to miss because of how easy it is to use. Therefore, many people tend to recommend this software. Audacity is an open-sourced MP3 music mixer that’s entirely free to use. It has a straightforward and interactive user interface that supports the most popular file types, including MP3, WAV, OGG, MIDI, and many more.

With Audacity, you can record right in the app or edit existing files as you miss. It also comes with many effects that you can utilize to improve your MP3 file. Another unique tool on Audacity is the spectrogram that allows you to analyze the audio frequencies. Audacity supports up to 32-bit audio files making it a powerful MP3 music mixer for Mac users.

This MP3 music mixer is ideal for beginners as its features are easy to navigate. However, this doesn’t mean that professional DJs and sound producers cannot also utilize this audio mixer. You can record audio to add to your MP3 using a mixer or a live microphone. It also lets you download digital recordings from social media platforms like YouTube. This free MP3 music mixer for Mac is a great option to explore.

In addition, WavePad offers a vast range of effects and supports audio bookmarking, which you would find very useful.

Other features these mixer offers are voice manipulation and text-to-speech functions. It is quite easy to use, making it an excellent option for beginners. Some of the effects people seem to love on this MP3 music mixer is the compression, noise removal, reverb, and many more. There’s also the analysis tool that advanced users can utilize to mix and edit their MP3 files.

With WavePad, speed and pitch changes are entirely possible. It also supports audio scrubbing, which is very handy. However, this file doesn’t support multi-tracking. Therefore, users can edit stereo or mono audio files on the software. Although its multi-window interface can take a while to get used to, this Mac MP3 music mixer is worth a try.

This MP3 music mixer comes with a clean and colorful user interface; it is easy to use and fast for mixing your MP3 files. WavePad has many effects like EQ, compression, and reverb, allowing you to tweak your MP3 files while mixing your music files. Unlike other MP3 mixers that are destructive when you are trying to edit the MP3 music file, this is not the case with Ocenaudio. With this software, you can tweak the parameters of the effect and hear the changes immediately.

Ocenaudio also supports VST; you can add your plugins when editing MP3 files. In addition, you can record audio straight in the software and use the spectrogram feature to visualize frequencies for advanced users. Professional music mixers would find this feature to be very welcoming.

Although it doesn’t support multi-track sessions, which means you can’t record several instruments and mix them, it is an excellent option for your mono file mixing. It is also quite simple to use compared to other basic MP3 music mixers for Mac.
