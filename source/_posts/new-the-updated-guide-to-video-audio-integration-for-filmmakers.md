With [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can easily add various format video to an audio track in MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file.

#### 1 Import your video and audio files

 Import your video and audio files into this editing software. Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) makes it easy by searching for your video and audio files.

#### 2 Start adding your video to audio

 Drag and drop your video files to the video timeline. Before adding video to audio, your video files may need editing. You can use this video editor to add clips together, trim sections or change any other features.

 Then add the audio file to the audio timeline. Crop and arrange the music to make it fit your video. To further edit your audio file, double click it to set fade in/out effects, speed up/slow down it, and adjust volume in the pop up window.
