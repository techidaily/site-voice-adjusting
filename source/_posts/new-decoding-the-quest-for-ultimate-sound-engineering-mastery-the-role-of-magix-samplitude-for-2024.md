_"Can you explain to us the simple method to execute **audio ducking**?”_

I hope you're already aware of **the audio ducking** feature if you're into video editing or any music industry. The audio ducking is commonly to balance two audios. You can see the very typical application while balancing the background music with the person speaking there. So, the different voices would pop up and needs an adjustment according to the scenario. However, selecting the most straightforward process and genuine video editor is the user's responsibility to get the task done effectively. So, here, we would like to discuss the audio ducking function of **CyberLink PowerDirector** along with a suitable alternative - **Wondershare Filmora**.

## Part 1: How to Use Audio Ducking to Fade Out Music in PowerDirector?

**CyberLink PowerDirector** is a video editing software with impeccable features, including Motion Tracking, Magic Movie Wizard, Encoding, Action Camera Tools, and so on. The **audio ducking** element in PowerDirector has automated the audio adjustment in terms of keyframes.

So, let's consider the below steps to **fade out music** or **fade out audio** in PowerDirector audio ducking!

**Step 1: Import Video**

Open the **CyberLink PowerDirector** application, and import the video into the timeline, as shown below. Then, you can also import the background music you'd like to add to the video.

**Step 2: Select Audio Ducking**

Choose the background music and hit the “Audio Ducking” option from the **Tools** tab.

**Step 3: Confirm the Audio Ducking**

A pop-up **audio ducking** window like the below interface will appear to state that PowerDirector will automatically analyze the music.

All you need, is to hit the **OK** button and lend the job to PowerDirector.

Doing so will automatically add the keyframes into the background music you’ve already imported.

So, this was the entire process of **music ducking** keyframes automation in **CyberLink PowerDirector**.

## Part 2: An Alternative Solution to Audio Ducking on Mac

If you’re looking for easiness, you must consider the following section for a suitable alternative!

_“Which **audio ducking** software is the best for Mac?”_

The [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is not only suitable for Mac users but Windows users as well. Here are some of its features on why we used to admire Filmora for easiness and professionalism.

All in all, the Wondershare Filmora is a remarkable video editor fulfilling the needs of endless people around the globe. It’s usually the first name in mind when it comes to innovation and simplicity.

Here is a step-by-step tutorial after which you can compare the audio ducking easiness of Wondershare Filmora with CyberLink PowerDirector.

So, let’s start without further ado!

**Step 1: Install Wondershare Filmora**

Click on the **Try It Free** button above to download and install Wondershare Filmora. Once the software installation is complete, launch it.

**Step 2: Import the Video**

Choose “New Project” from the primary interface, and now, go to the “Import” option to add or import the media files. You can also do a drag-and-drop.

**Step 3: Select the Audio Option**

Double-click the video or right-click the audio to choose the “Adjust Audio” option on the timeline that will lead you to the editing window.

**Step 4: Employ Audio Ducking**

You are almost there whereby tick the “**Lower the volume of other clips”** checkbox to proceed. Using the slider, swipe it to set the degree to which you want to lower the volume of background music.

So, these simple steps are required to enable **audio ducking** in Wondershare Filmora. So easy! Along with it, you can also consider using the **Fade Out** and **Pitch** slider tab for versatile audio adjustment. However, you must only check for the **Ducking** tab, especially when you’re a beginner and don’t want to go for extreme changes.

## Conclusion

Thus, with a discussion over two different ways to implement the **audio ducking** feature, it's time to state our final overview. No doubt, the PowerDirector audio ducking feature offers the simplistic way, but it lacks flexibility. Due to the keyframe setting's automation, you can't check for a specific part in the audio and adjust the volume as per your needs. However, this could have been done pretty quickly in Wondershare Filmora's video editor, making it the best alternative to CyberLink PowerDirector. Keeping it the top priority, begin your journey today!
