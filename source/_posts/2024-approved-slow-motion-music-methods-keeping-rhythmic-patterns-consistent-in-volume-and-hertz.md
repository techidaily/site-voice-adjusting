_I have a High Definition MKV video here with 2 audio tracks: Russian and English. I want to turn this video to DVD but how would I remove the Russian and keep just the English audio?_

Sometimes you might come across the same problem: got a piece of HD video with more than one audio track and want to remove the extra audio track. Or you may want to remove all the audio tracks and add some other audio files to it later.
