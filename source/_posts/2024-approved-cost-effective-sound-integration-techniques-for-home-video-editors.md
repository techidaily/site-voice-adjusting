Have you ever heard a song you really like, but you had no way to find out its title or the name of the artist? The Beatfind app is just like [Shazam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shazam/id284993459?mt=8) music recognition app, but with audio visualization options, as it enables you to discover new music just moments after you hear it for the first time. The music recognition mode that uses the ACR Cloud technology identifies the song if the app is active and near a speaker. The app’s music visualizer relies on your phone’s microphone to gather sound data and synchronize the visuals with the audio input. However, Beatfind doesn’t provide the tools that allow you to customize or record your music visualizations.
