## Part 2: The Most Frequently Asked Questions about Podcast Hosting Platforms

 In order to add episodes of your podcasts to podcast directories, you must meet only three requirements. Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.

### What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?

 All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.

### Why do I need podcast hosting services?

 Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.

### How to select the right podcast hosting platform?

 The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.

 However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.

### Is podcast hosting free?

 Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.

### What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?

 The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99\. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.

**Conclusion**

 Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added. Which podcast hosting platform are you using to publish your podcasts? Leave a comment and let us know.

## Part 2: The Most Frequently Asked Questions about Podcast Hosting Platforms

 In order to add episodes of your podcasts to podcast directories, you must meet only three requirements. Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.

### What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?

 All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.

### Why do I need podcast hosting services?

 Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.

### How to select the right podcast hosting platform?

 The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.

 However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.

### Is podcast hosting free?

 Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.

### What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?

 The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99\. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.

**Conclusion**

 Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added. Which podcast hosting platform are you using to publish your podcasts? Leave a comment and let us know.

Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.

### What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?

 The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99\. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.

**Conclusion**

 Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added. Which podcast hosting platform are you using to publish your podcasts? Leave a comment and let us know.

## Part 2: The Most Frequently Asked Questions about Podcast Hosting Platforms

 In order to add episodes of your podcasts to podcast directories, you must meet only three requirements. Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.

### What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?

 All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.

### Why do I need podcast hosting services?

 Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.

### How to select the right podcast hosting platform?

 The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.

 However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.

### Is podcast hosting free?

 Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.

* [Part3: Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting](#part3)
* [Part4: How to create a Video Podcast?](#part4)

## What is a Video Podcast?

In simple words, a video podcast is generally a video format of audio podcasts. Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can't listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well. It is a version of podcasting despite other formats or versions of podcasts, including interview format, startup format, etc.

## Video Podcast v/s Vlog: What’s the Difference?

There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.

**Type of Content**

The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.

**Style**

The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.

**Type of Versions**

You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo/ Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.

## Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting

There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale. As mentioned earlier, it won't be that easy if you are not consistent and committed. It will also help if you consider the following advantages and disadvantages of video podcasting as follows.

Pros of Video Podcasts

**Easy Accessibility**

An easy reach and wide accessibility is the first significant advantage of hosting a podcast. Every second person nowadays is fond of listening to podcasts, whether in audio or video formats. A podcast is a whole pack of informational content that doesn’t need further FAQs and similar issues to mention separately. On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.

A video podcast is the better alternative if you don't have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.

**Convenient**

Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube. Due to convenience, they are pretty similar to listening to an audio podcast, which is also free of cost except for your internet charges. A YouTube-hosted video podcast doesn't need a paid subscription.

**Encourages productivity**

The very idea of presenting a podcast is to offer authentic information formally. It doesn't matter what format you choose to host the best video podcast; it contains reliable information and the elements to encourage productivity in viewers' minds.

Cons of Video Podcasts

**The challenging process of finding a relevant audience**

It may be super tough to find the relevant audience in the beginning. You may have to advertise on YouTube to see the audience. Else, a strategic marketing policy for your channel to ensure consistency and retention of followers or audience.

**Time Consuming**

Making a video podcast is generally a time-consuming procedure, specifically when you are new to the technical aspects. Well, a person who is passionate about podcasting can even hire a video editor to fulfill the editing and similar tasks. But that won't be beneficial in the long run. It's essential to learn video podcasting and further video editing to cut costs on a long-term basis.

**Distracting**

You should not create a podcast if it is distracting the audience within the first five minutes. That's the primary concern as creating visually appealing video podcasts is more than challenging, especially for a beginner. Due to the podcasting hype, many creators develop video podcasts that are not even useful and highly distracting for the audience.

## How to create a Video Podcast?

Let’s review the step-by-step guide to create a video podcast, as mentioned below!

Step 1: Content Preparation

![Content Preparation For Video Podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/content-preparation-for-video-podcast.jpg)

So yes, the content preparation is essential and foremost! Check the field and podcast format for which you can create the most awesome content. You must also address the target audience as your first step using various research tools, such as Facebook Groups, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, etc. You can also look at several types of podcast formats discussed above to get started.

Step 2: Recording

![Record Podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast.jpg)

A recording is all about using the ideal equipment and setup. It also depends upon your selection of format. For instance, a video podcast in an interview may not need the other guest as in-person if they have a virtual presence. You can record with the on-screen recorder then. Remember to follow the basics of recording, such as facing the camera and remaining in the frame.

Step 3: Editing

Now, there's a turn to edit the raw video. Editing can be in various forms and can be time-consuming if you are not doing it right. For this purpose, a good video editor is more than crucial. Generally, you are required to adjust the audio and pop in a little video effect with interactive video intros and outros. We want to recommend you the updated and easy to use video editor, namely the Wondershare Filmora X. It has a huge list of stunning video and audio effects with an inbuilt music library to craft your podcasts in the most professional way.
