### Key Features

* Picard has a variety of plug-in support. If you need anything, you can look into the available plug-in, or even you can write your own.
* It uses AcoustID audio fingerprints. This makes them identifiable by actual audio even there is no metadata available for the particular file.
* Picard supports all the popular formats that are used. These formats include MP3, M4A, FLAC, WMA, OGG, WAV, and many more.

### Bottom Line

The article solely focused on sharing and discussing Mac MP3 tag editors. We hope that this article proves helpful for you. Let’s also talk a little about [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the platform that has made editing easy.

You just name a feature, and Filmora will already have it. The editor offers Basic options like merge, split, cut, trim, etc. If we talk about Advanced options, you get AI Portrait, Normalization, Stabilize Video, Auto Reframe, and much more than this.
