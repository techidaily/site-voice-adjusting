Is adding an **audio keyframe** in Wondershare Filmora for Mac easy? Else is the interface too tough to follow? Keep your confusion aside and take a look at the below step-by-step guide on how to perform **audio keyframing** in Wondershare Filmora for Mac.

**Step 1**: **Launch to** **Add Media Files**

Launch or open the Wondershare Filmora on your Mac. Then, add a media file or the video file into the work panel by dragging-dropping the file into the timeline.

You can also execute “**File > Import Media > Import media files**” to bring the files into the timeline.

**Step 2**: **Edit Audio**

Once your video reaches the timeline, double-clicking on it will take you to the editing menu to choose the “**Audio**” tab.

Increase or decrease the volume level based on which the clips should play.

**Step 3**: **Adjust Volume and Add Keyframe**

Place the pointer on the timeline where you want to add an **audio keyframe.** Then double-click the audio clip that will again redirect you to the Audio panel.

Now, click on the keyframe icon on the left side panel, make the volume adjustment on the timeline by dragging the volume envelope, and tapping the “OK” button.

To add the second **audio keyframe**, move the playhead to the desired spot, and once done, perform step 3 again.

## Part 2: How to Modify Audio Keyframes in Filmora for Mac?

Not only adding an **audio keyframe** is possible in Wondershare Filmora for Mac, but modifying or **adjust the audio** keyframe is possible as well.
