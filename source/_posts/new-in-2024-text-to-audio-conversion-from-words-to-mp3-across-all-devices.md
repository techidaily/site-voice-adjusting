### 5\. [Online Tone Generator](http://onlinetonegenerator.com/pitch-shifter.html)

Besides primarily being a noise generating platform, Online Tone Generator also offers a tool you can use to modulate voices. However, you can’t record audio with this tool, and you must use another online platform or DAW to create an audio file you would like to modulate with this platform. Furthermore, the Pitch Shifter tool only lets you [change the pitch of an audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)file by using the Pitch Shift slider or inserting a new value into the box next to the Semitones option.

The download process is needlessly complicated since you make sure that the Save output to downloadable file checkbox is selected, then play the audio file for as long as you would like the output file to be, and then click on the link that is displayed in the Recordings section of the screen. All audio files you edit with the Pitch Shifter tool are going to be saved in MP3 format.

### 6\. [LingoJam – Female to Male Voice Changer](https://lingojam.com/FemaletoMaleVoiceChanger)

LingoJam is a website where you can create your own online translator, or discover translators that were created by LingoJam’s users. The platform’s Female to Male Voice Changer tool lets you record or upload an audio clip and then select one of the available pitch options.

![Free Female to Male Voice Changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/female-to-male-voice-changer.jpg)

Besides selecting a low or high pitch you can also apply the Chipmunk or Mountain Troll preset voice effects to your audio recordings. As soon as you upload an audio file or finish an audio recording session the file will be displayed in the Output Audio section of the screen where you can listen to the result before you download them to your computer. You can’t choose the output file format, and all voice recordings you edit with this tool are going to be saved in the WAV file format.

### 7\. [Voice Spice Recorder](https://voicespice.com/)

You can record new audio or use the platform’s Text-to-Speech option to start the voice changing process, but uploading a file to Voice Spice Recorder from your computer isn’t available. The platform provides you with a basic set of audio recording settings that enable you to choose how loud your microphone will be or if you want to apply an effect like Hell Demon, Space Squirrel, or change the voice from male to male female.

![change voice online with voicespice recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-voice-with-online-voice-spice-recorder.jpg)

After recording your voice, you can click on the Save button and add the title of the file, its author, or comments. Voice Spice Recorder lets you choose to share your audio file on Facebook, Twitter or create a sharable link. Optionally, you can also use Voice Spice Recorder to browse through the recordings created by other platform users.

### Conclusion

Changing voices in your [audio recordings online is a free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and simple process that takes a minimum amount of time and effort. Most of the [voice changers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you can find on the Internet offer different preset voice effects but fail to provide the tools you need to edit audio files you create with them.
