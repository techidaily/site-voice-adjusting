## "Audio Removal Guide for MP4 Files (2024 Edition)"

While editing an MP4 (MPEG/MPG) clip, we may want to remove audio from the MP4 file completely instead of muting the audio and getting only the video stream as an output.

Sometimes we may want to remove audio from the original file and add a new sound tracker.
