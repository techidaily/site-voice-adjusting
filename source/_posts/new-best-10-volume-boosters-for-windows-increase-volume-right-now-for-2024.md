![Online VoiceOverMaker.io  Voice Generator  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voiceovermaker.jpg)

You can also convert the text-to-speech audio into MP3, MP4, or WAV files and download them with this application. You can register for the free voice over generator version of VoiceOverMaker on their website. But this version will allow you to convert only 800 characters. If you want a voice over for more than that, you must purchase the software. There are three different paid versions - Standard, Medium, and Large - you can choose one that suits your needs.

### 5. Text2VoiceOver

Looking for a free voice over generator online that will help you add voice overs to your videos? Head on to [Text2VoiceOver](https://text2voiceover.com/). This software provides you with automatic text-to-speech conversion. It will convert each piece of your text into separate MP3 files for you to use.

This software comes with 13 different languages in 15 voices.

Text2VoiceOver has a free and a paid version from which you can choose. The free version will help you create individual audio files for each piece of text you convert.

### 6. NaturalReader Online

We have talked about the NaturalReader Software. Now, let’s tell you about [NaturalReader Online](https://www.naturalreaders.com/webapp.html). This application is slightly different from the software version. Unlike NaturalReader Software, you can use NaturalReader Online as a free voice over generator for your web pages by using it as a Chrome extension. With this app, you can also edit pronunciation and bookmark sections of your text to read later. You also get over 100 natural voices in 16 languages.

There is one free version of this free voice over generator online, but you can use it to read-only 20 minutes every day. The paid versions of NaturalReader Online are monthly subscription packs and allow you to access a complete range of features.

### 7. VoiceoverMaker.com

Another excellent feature of this software is adding pauses and whispers like a natural voice anywhere you want in the text.

This voice over generator allows you to take a free trial, but you will have to register and purchase the software for accessing all the features. They also have unique category-based voices like Animation & Gaming, Kids Stories, and Financial Services. You can go to their website and check them out for free.

![ TTSReader Online Voice Generator  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ttsreader-online-voice-generator.jpg)

This app is a free voice over a generator that you can also use as a Chrome extension to convert the text on websites to audio. It remembers where you stopped reading and automatically bookmarks it for you. This way, you can resume reading from where you paused when you come back.

TTSReader also has an app to download on your Android and iOS phones. However, if you want to download the audio you converted from your text files, you can only do that on Windows devices.

### Final Thoughts

As you can see, you can choose from the many free voice over generators online. Most software applications have free and paid versions, from which you can choose according to your convenience.
