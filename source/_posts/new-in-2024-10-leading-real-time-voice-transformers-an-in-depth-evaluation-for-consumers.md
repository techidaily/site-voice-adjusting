## "Experience Unparalleled Audio Quality on Windows with These 10 Tools (2022 Update)"

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

Normalization is still a useful feature that helps to equalize volume in different files. Let us look at some of the best audio normalizers available in Windows.

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 4\. [MP3Gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/)

### 5\. [VLC Video Player](https://www.videolan.org/)

To normalize more than one audio clip make sure that the audio level of each clip is set to 0 dB. This can be done by tapping on Edit and then on Remove Attributes. So for better results, make sure that the audio level of each clip is set to 0dB before normalization.
