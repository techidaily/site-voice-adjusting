The methods shared here demonstrate how different tools can be used to separate vocals and beats in an audio file. Each uses a different approach and provides a certain quality level of output. However, we recommend Wondershare Filmora because of its phenomenal audio and editing features. In addition to extracting beats from your favorite songs, the software allows you to edit the files further for other purposes.
