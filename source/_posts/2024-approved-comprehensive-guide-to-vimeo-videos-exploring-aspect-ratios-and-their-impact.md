Firstly, the audio recording needs to be uploaded to Adobe Premiere Pro. We can also directly record the audio in the Premiere Pro timeline.

Secondly, we will choose the effect we wish to apply. In this case, the "Pitch Shifter" effect is applied. Tap on the effects list, choose "pitch shifter," and then drag down to the audio file.

Next, it’s time to adjust the pitch as per the need. We can shift the pitch higher for a sharp female voice or down for heavier vocals. If you now have achieved the desired results, you know how to use this anime girl voice changer.

Besides the Pitch Shifter feature in Premiere Pro, you can also use the equalizer to adjust the voice too. With an equalizer, you can give nasal effects to your audio. This effect is usually a popular trend with anime voice changers. To give nasal effects, you have to load the EQ first. Next, you need to cut or boost the frequencies as per your need. The limit provided is usually 1k to 1.2k Hz.

These are the main effects one gets to choose from when using Adobe Premiere.
