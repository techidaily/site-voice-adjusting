For a [recording to have good audio quality](https://blogs.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/4-simple-tips-for-recording-high-quality-audio/), it needs to have as little background noise as possible. Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.

**Noise reduction** is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.

The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do **noise reduction in Audacity**.

## Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/) is a lightweight opensource audio recording and editing software that’s used by many serious podcasters and vloggers. It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE. You can know more infomation of Audacity from [PCmag review](https://www.pcmag.com/review/362572/audacity). This recording will provide a clear sample of the background noise in the room and will be very useful in the noise reduction process. See steps below:

* The first step is to create a NOISE PROFILE. This profile tells Audacity the nature of the noise to be reduced or eliminated from the audio recording. To create a NOISE PROFILE, open your ROOM TONE recording and click on EFFECT > NOISE REDUCTION.
* If you didn’t make a ROOM TONE recording, then open the audio file you want to process. Once opened, click and drag over a section that contains mostly noise to select it. Then, click on EFFECT > NOISE REDUCTION.

![audacity noise reduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/audacity-noise-reduction.jpg)

* Once a new window labelled ‘STEP 1’ opens, click on the ‘GET NOISE PROFILE’ button. This creates the NOISE PROFILE which Audacity will use in the noise reduction process.

![apply audacity noise reduction](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/apply-noise-reduction.jpg)

* Next, select the entire audio file that requires noise reduction. Then, select NOISE REDUCTION from the EFFECTS tab on the top menu bar.
* When the new window labelled ‘STEP 2’ opens, take your time to enter the settings that give you the desired level of noise reduction. Carefully adjust the bands for NOISE REDUCTION, SENSITIVITY and FREQUENCY SMOOTHING.

![manually reduce noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/set-how-to-reduce-noise.jpg)

* Now, click the PREVIEW button to hear the effect of your noise reduction settings. If you are not satisfied with the preview, you can adjust the settings bars until you achieve a good result.
* You should also click on the RESIDUE radio button to hear the sounds that will be eliminated from your recording if your chosen settings are applied. This can be very useful as some settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. If you hear valuable audio content captured in the residue, adjust your settings accordingly. Try as much as possible to minimize the loss of valuable audio content.
* Once you are satisfied with your audio preview and residue, click the OK button with the REDUCE radio button selected. This will perform the noise reduction effect on your audio recording.

## Conclusion

Keep in mind that noise reduction is not a perfect process and strong noise reduction settings can result in the loss of valuable audio content. Whether you choose to use Audacity or Filmora, try to strike the right balance between getting rid of background sounds and retaining valuable audio content.

## Essential Insights Into the World of Free Stock Images via Pexels.com

![pexels 4k](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-4k-1.jpg)

There is a great way to make your messages more impactful that is free to use. Pexels is an online creative assets library that features high-resolution photos, including Pexels 4k, and an assortment of audio clips you can use in your creations.

The following are things you need to know about Pexels.com. It includes details on what Pexels is, important user information, and other hidden features of the website. Keep reading to find out more.

## Part1: Is Pexels.com free to use?

Yes, Pexels.com is a free online library of stock photos that you can use for personal or commercial purposes with your creations. In addition, photographers submit their images to the platform to allow others to reuse them.

Pexels' free download policy allows you to obtain images under the Pexels or Creative common licensing rules. In addition, both licenses allow you to use Pexels images and videos for personal and commercial purposes, provided you make alterations to the original.

According to the site's founders, the following are the reasons why the site is free:

* Its main source of revenue is selling advertisement slots to other paid-content databases.
* You can also donate to the website's operational costs with a single click. In addition, there is no limitation on how much and how often you can donate.
* Most of the site's contributors do so willingly to increase their brand exposure. For example, a verified user states that uploading his content to Pexels 4k and Pexels audio has resulted in an influx of high-paying customers.

So, what is the difference between paid and stock photo sites? Paid content databases such as Shutterstock and Deposit photos require you to create a user ID and subscribe to their service. Conversely, stock photo sites like Pexels.com feature free stock images and videos that you can use with minimal restrictions.

For example, the site allows you to use its content on YouTube for personal or commercial reasons, provided you make adjustments to the original asset, and you own the video. In addition, the site's library features content that its contributors share willingly. As such, you can download content from these sites without creating an account or acknowledging the image owner.

Currently, you can access Pexels through your web browser or download the app on your Android or iOS device. In addition, you can also access the asset library through the Canva application following their merger. Furthermore, you can also download it as a plugin for different content creation software, including Photoshop, MS Office, and Google Slides.

## Part2: What can Pexels provide you?

Now that you are aware of Pexels.com's origin story and access methods, here is a rundown of what free access provides you.

### 1\. 4K images for almost all topics

Pexels.com features a dedicated library of over 40,000 4k images from their contributors. You can access the library by typing 4k in the site's search engine. In addition, the library is full of 4k images across various topics, including niche subjects such as Nebula and Abstract. Furthermore, the site's search engine uses search tags to provide more accurate results. For example, by typing 4K Dark in the search engine, the site can narrow down your search to provide more relevant results.

### 2\. Audio

You also get access to Pexels audio, a collection of over 8000 audio clips from the site's numerous contributors. In addition, all of the Pexels audio's content is completely free to use for all users. Currently, you can only access the database through your web browser and the iOS app.

### 3\. Video

Another content category that your free access provides you is Pexels video. The database features a collection of over 2000 video clips you can use for your commercial or personal works. In addition, Pexels.com offers various editing tools to make alterations immediately. Furthermore, you also have templates for different content configurations, including social media and YouTube posts.

## Part3: What's Leaderboard and Challenges on Pexels.com?

![leaderboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-4k-2.jpg)

The Pexels free download leaderboard is a list of the site's top contributors within the past thirty days. The ranking is based on the number of views of photos and videos you submit within thirty days. For example, you earn the top spot if you receive the most views to your content, provided it is less than thirty days old. As such, each contributor has an equal chance of rising to the top, provided they put in the effort.

![pexels](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/pexels-4k-3.jpg)

On the other hand, Pexels challenges are monthly competitions where contributors submit their best work to win different prizes. Typically, each challenge varies in the category, prizes, and content specifications. For example, the most recent challenge required contributors to upload images projecting friendship.

In addition, there is no limitation to the number of eligible uploads because challenge officials consider all of them. Finally, all images you submit for the Pexels challenge fall under the Pexels license, meaning they are free to use by the site's visitors.

## Part4: What are not allowed on Pexels?

Currently, all of the Pexels creative assets are under the Pexels license, a variation to the creative commons zero license other stock photo sites offer. Although you can access and download the site's assets for free, there are some restrictions on your usage of them. Here is what Pexels.com's free download license does not allow you to do with its assets.

### 1\. It can't be used in a political context

You cannot use Pexels free download videos, images, and audio clips in a political context. This is because some of the assets include identifiable people, and using their image may be seen as their endorsement of your political beliefs. In addition, the situation becomes worse if your ideology contains offensive material and messaging.

Furthermore, the Pexels license also bans using their creative assets to promote your personal brand, especially when they contain any identifiable imagery. By doing so, Pexels.com remains a free resource for people of all creeds, regardless of their political affiliations.

### 2\. Resell the resources

Another thing you cannot do when using Pexels.com is to resell their photos and videos to other stock photograph platforms. Most users attribute this to the site's owners wanting to maintain a fresher database than its competitors.

In addition, you can also consider the restriction as a way to prevent duplication of results on web searches and prevent the overuse of creative assets. As such, you cannot use their creative assets on items such as print media and physical goods, including T-shirts and mugs.

## Part5: FAQs

### Why should you create a Pexels account?

Pexels.com seeks to create a simple and fast medium for you to discover free photos and videos. It does so by providing a common platform where contributors can share their work with a greater audience. Here are some of the benefits of creating a Pexels.com account:

* You can create collections for different projects, accessible on different dashboards.
* Continuous free access to every creative asset you have ever downloaded. For example, you can access all images you have downloaded from Pexels 4K.
* You also get a custom homepage that features your latest work and database favorites.
* In addition, you will have access to the site's community, which has helpful information for all users.

### What are the rules for uploading videos on Pexels.com?

Here are the requirements for uploading videos on Pexels.com:

* Your videos must be of resolution 1920 X 1080 and higher.
* All videos should be free of explicit content such as nudity or violence.
* Your videos should not feature any watermarks, branding, or borders.
* The recording and scene transitions should be seamless.
* The site does not permit the uploading of animations.

* All photos need to be at least 4 megapixels and have a minimum resolution of 2592 X 1520 pixels.
* Your images should not contain any explicit material. All photos with graphic nudity and violence are banned from the website.
* Your photos should be well-oriented and should not include watermarks, text elements, or borders when uploading them to your pexelx.com account.

### Does Pexels.com accept uploading of mobile photos?

Yes. Using the app, you can upload images from your smartphone's internal storage directly to Pexels.com. In addition, other requirements must be met before your photo is approved. You can find out more from the upload guidelines on pexel.com.

### What alterations can you make to use Pexels photos on your merchandise?

Pexels allows you to use its images for personal and commercial reasons if you alter them and make them your own. Some of the alterations the site recommends include:

* Adding graphic elements to the images using Pexels.com's editing tool.
* Using part of the Pexels image in a greater project such as a collage or wallpaper.
