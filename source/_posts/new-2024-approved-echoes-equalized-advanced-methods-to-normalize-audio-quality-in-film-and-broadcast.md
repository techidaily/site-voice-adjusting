Audio recordings are not always perfect since they can often be too loud or nearly inaudible. In case you are dealing with an audio or video file that has an unbalanced volume you can try to fix this issue by using the **audio normalization** features which video and audio editing apps for Mac and PC computers offer.

* [Part 2: How to Normalize Audio \[Tutorial\] ](#part2)
* [Part 3: Top Sound Normalizers](#part3)
* [Part 4: Audio Normalization Tips](#part4)

## What is Audio Normalization?

There are two different types of audio normalization, peak normalization, and loudness normalization. The peak normalization changes the gain that is being applied in order to reduce the highest PCM sample value down to 0 dB, while the loudness normalization reduces the average amplitude to the chosen level. However, the majority of video and audio editing apps combine these two types of audio normalization into a single feature. So, in this article, we are going to show you how you can quickly normalize audio with different video and audio editing apps.

## How to Normalize Audio?

The most common reason for using audio normalization features is to bring the audio level of several different audio clips to the same level. In addition, audio normalization can help you make inaudible narration or dialogue a bit louder. If you want to make your vocals pop over the background music, all you have to do is download a versatile software - [Filmora from Wondershare](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The latest version of Filmora has released a new function - audio ducking, which helps you increase your vocals while lower the background music with ease. Download it for free!

## Best 3 Audio Normalizers

Except for Wondershare Filmora, there are other audio normalizers that you can use when you are edit videos. Moreover, we will know the steps of normalizing audios with these sound normalizers.

#### 1. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

![sound normalizer iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-interface-best-video-editor.jpg)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** macOS

Mac users don’t need a special introduction to this iconic video editing app that has been featured on all versions of macOS that were released since 2003\. The process of normalizing audio with iMovie is rather simple as you just have to import an audio or video file that contains sound into the **Project Browser** **and double-click on it.** Once **the Inspector pops up on the screen** you should select the **Audio option** and click on the **Normalize Clip Volume setting**. iMovie will then normalize the audio in the selected file, so you should just wait for the process to be over and click **Done** afterward.

#### 2. [Movavi](https://www.movavi.com/)

![sound normalizer Movavi](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movavi-audio-edit.jpg)

**Price:** $79.95 for a lifetime license

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

Movavi video editor offers all the tools you are going to need to finish the video editing process quickly. This video editing software for Mac and PC computers is best suited for video content creators who don’t have a lot of experience, although skilled video editing professionals can also use it to edit their footage. The audio normalization process in Movavi can be completed in just a few easy steps. After creating the project in the **Full Feature Mode**, you should click on the **Add Media Files icon** and import the files you’d like to use in that project. Place the files to the appropriate track on the timeline and then **double-click on the file that is located on the audio track.** Once the **Tools panel** appears on the screen, you just have to **make sure that the Normalize tickbox is checked** and Movavi will normalize the audio automatically.

#### 3. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

![sound normalizer Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-audio-editor.jpg)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Linux, Windows, macOS

Audacity is a professional audio editing app that lets you record and edit sound for your videos. You can use this app to create sound effects, merge multiple audio files together, or record narration for each new video you create. **Normalizing audio with Audacity** is easy because you just have to **add the audio clips to the timeline** and **make sure that the track to which you added a file is selected.** The app also lets you select more than just one track, so you can place audio files to two or more tracks and files from each track are going to be adjusted to the same audio level. Once you’ve selected a track or tracks that contain audio clips you’d like to normalize, head over to the **Effects menu, choose the Normalize option, and hit OK**.

## Tips on Audio Normalization

A single scene can contain a lot of different sounds. The sound of someone’s footsteps, ambient sounds, or the dialogue are just a few examples of sounds that are frequently used in videos and movies. The audio volume of each of these sounds shouldn’t be the same, because if the ambient sounds are as loud as the dialogue the audience may find it hard to understand what the characters in that scene are saying. That’s why you should use audio normalization only when you are absolutely sure that using the same audio volume level for two or more audio clips won’t disrupt the flow of your video.

**Conclusion**

Even though normalizing audio with each of the video editing software products we featured in this article is a straightforward process, this option should only be used if you have no other way to balance the audio volume of a video or an audio file. Which video editing app for Mac and PC computers do you like to use the most to normalize audio in your videos? Leave a comment and share your experiences with us.

You can use this app to create sound effects, merge multiple audio files together, or record narration for each new video you create. **Normalizing audio with Audacity** is easy because you just have to **add the audio clips to the timeline** and **make sure that the track to which you added a file is selected.** The app also lets you select more than just one track, so you can place audio files to two or more tracks and files from each track are going to be adjusted to the same audio level. Once you’ve selected a track or tracks that contain audio clips you’d like to normalize, head over to the **Effects menu, choose the Normalize option, and hit OK**.

## Tips on Audio Normalization

A single scene can contain a lot of different sounds. The sound of someone’s footsteps, ambient sounds, or the dialogue are just a few examples of sounds that are frequently used in videos and movies. The audio volume of each of these sounds shouldn’t be the same, because if the ambient sounds are as loud as the dialogue the audience may find it hard to understand what the characters in that scene are saying. That’s why you should use audio normalization only when you are absolutely sure that using the same audio volume level for two or more audio clips won’t disrupt the flow of your video.

**Conclusion**

Even though normalizing audio with each of the video editing software products we featured in this article is a straightforward process, this option should only be used if you have no other way to balance the audio volume of a video or an audio file. Which video editing app for Mac and PC computers do you like to use the most to normalize audio in your videos? Leave a comment and share your experiences with us.

_With which tool can I add audio in an avi container? Because VDMod, Nandub and Avi-Mux is useless for this process..._

 Sometimes you may want to add audio to AVI but find many programs don't support this. So here I recommend a powerful video editing tool –[Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily add audio to AVI or other video formats such as MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add the files to the program

 Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.

![remove audio from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Adjust the audio file

 If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.

 Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.

![remove audio track from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/audio-detach.jpg)

#### 3 Save the new file

 After adding the audio and combining it with the video, you can export it as a new file. Click “Create ” and select “Format” tab. In the output window, select the required format. You can also go to the “Device” tab and export with the ready-made preset for your mobile device. Of course, you can also directly upload it to YouTube for sharing with the world or burn to DVD for playing on home TV.

## "Top 10 Platforms for Accessing Professional Montage Music Tracks"

In music, montage is a technique whereby newly branded compositions or sound objects, such as songs, are created from montage or collage. We will give you all the information you need to know before going for a montage music download. We will also highlight where you can get music tracks to add to your montage video.

## Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music

Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:

#### 1\. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device

Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.

If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.

#### 2\. The Safety of Your Device

When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.

Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.

Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.

#### 3\. Internet Connectivity

You'll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.

If you download montage music using a phone contract, there's a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.

If you've got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.

#### 4\. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music

When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.

Before you download any montage music online, read the download site's terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.

#### 5\. The Quality of the Montage Music File

Some montage music files you'll find online are of low quality. And this can affect your audience's listening experience. Before you get any downloadable montage music, check its quality.

## Top 10 Websites to Download Montage Music

There are lots of sites where you can download montage music tracks. We'll look at the top ten websites to find downloadable montage music.
