[2: Configure your PC sound settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[5: Update/Reinstall Discord](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Before we dive into anything advanced, try restarting Discord and your PC to see if it was just a random glitch.

## Fix 1: Check Discord audio settings

 When Discord voice chat stops working, the first thing you can look at is the voice and audio settings.

1. Launch Discord and log into your account.
2. On the bottom-left corner, make sure you’re**unmuted** and also have**turned on the audio** . Then click the**gear-shape icon** to open settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snipaste_2021-10-21_16-37-18.png)
3. On the left panel, click the**Voice & Video** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snipaste_2021-10-21_16-37-56.png)
4. Under Voice Settings, make sure the**correct input and output devices** are selected. You can also**adjust the volumes** accordingly or do a mic test.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snipaste_2021-10-21_16-40-44.png)
5. Select**Voice Activity** as the input mode, and turn off**Automatically determine input sensitivity** . Thereby, you can set up the volume level for Discord to recognize and pick up your voice but not the noise.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snipaste_2021-10-21_16-41-23.png)

 You can test if Discord voice chat is working now. If adjusting the voice settings in Discord doesn’t help, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Configure your PC sound settings

 When Discord voice chatting is not working, another basic troubleshooting step you can try is to correctly configure the sound settings on your PC.

1. In the search bar on your taskbar, type in sound input then click **Sound input device properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/search-sound-input.jpg)
2. **Select the device you’re using as the input device** . Usually, it’s your headset mic.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/set-input-device.jpg)
3. Next, right-click the little speaker icon on your taskbar, then click **Sounds** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-05-07_16-48-56.jpg)
4. Go to the **Recording** tab and find your headset. If you don’t see it, right-click an empty area then select **Show Disabled Devices** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-05-07_16-57-37.jpg)
5. Right-click your headset device, then click **Enable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-05-07_17-05-17.jpg)
6. Click **Apply** then **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-05-07_17-06-58.jpg)

 The device you’re using for Discord voice chatting is now set as the input device and allowed for recording. You can now test if Discord picks up your voice. If your problem persists, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 The glitches could be triggered by a faulty or outdated audio driver. If your Discord voice chat still doesn’t work, you can check if you have the latest audio driver, and update it if needed.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your audio driver via Device Manager (a Windows feature). Note that although Windows will automatically search for the available updates for your audio driver, you may get no results since Windows doesn’t update its database very often.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the most recent driver for your exact sound card as well as your Windows version. Then it will download and install the driver correctly:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-07_17-54-35.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged audio driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

## Fix 4: Reset voice settings on Discord

 Some users have been able to fix the voice chat feature by resetting voice settings on Discord. This only takes a few simple clicks and it’s definitely worth a try. Here’s how:

1. Launch Discord. On the bottom-left corner, click the**gear-shaped icon** to open settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Snipaste_2021-10-21_17-27-58.png)
2. Under the**Voice & Video** tab, scroll down and click**Reset Voice Settings** .

## Fix 5: Update/Reinstall Discord

 Updating your Discord desktop client can usually fix known bugs and may increase the stability of the software. If you’re reinstalling Discord, make sure you delete all the local files before you reinstall it. A clean reinstall usually helps when the problem was caused by corrupted local cache.
