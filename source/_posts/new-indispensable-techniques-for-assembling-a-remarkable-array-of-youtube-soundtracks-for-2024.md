* You can add recorded voiceover, replace/detach the video's original audio, split, and adjust audio that suits the video.
* Get access to varied options like audio fade in/out, audio equalizer (EQ), and audio mixer with Filmora from Wondershare.

#### 3\.  KineMaster

KineMaster is a video editor app that can be readily downloaded from the App Store or Google Play to be accessed anywhere on your device. It is compatible audio ducking software with handy editing functions that are easy-to-use, simple, and fun.

KineMaster supports three-phases: Create, Edit, and Share, where you can transform your video with a diverse feature-set like blending modes, video layers, Chroma key, and still a lot more.

**Pros**

* You can add background audio to the videos to improve the tone of the video.
* KineMaster supports audio editing over the latest operating system and multiple platforms as well.

**Cons**

* The system crashes at times leading to the repetition of the process again.

#### 4\.  LumaFusion

If you are a mobile journalist, filmmaker, or a professional video producer searching for a powerful multi-track video editor, here is LumaFusion from the house of LumaTouch. It is a premier professional solution embedded with a media library, video editing tools, titler, audio editing, effects, share options, and project management.

You can add keyframe audio levels to the audio editing phase, panning perfect mixers, adding audio filters, EQ, and auto-ducking action.

**Pros**

* Preview and listen to your edit while adjusting the audio track levels.
* For dual-mono audio captures, get access to fill-from-left and fill-from-right options.

**Cons**

* LumaFusion never allows iCloud sync between devices.

#### 5\.  OBS

OBS studio is our final audio ducking software, an open-source platform developed especially for live-streaming and recording purposes. With reliability over Windows, Linux, and macOS, one can utilize multiple sources, record audio, add video clips, and streamline settings panels.

Powered with powerful API technology, real-time video/audio capturing, and high-performance audio mixing, OBS Studio uses native plug-ins and customization schemes for high-performance output deliverance. Thus, it is one of our listings.

**Pros**

* OBS supports an intuitive audio mixer, per-source filters, noise gate, gain, and noise suppression.
* With OBS, you can take full control over the VST plug-in support for audio.

**Cons**

* The process of installing the plug-in associated with audio & video needs improvement.

### Conclusion

Each audio ducking software in this article proved their expertise. Adobe Premium Pro is good-to-go for Photoshop for professional video editing, KineMaster, a friendly handy mobile application, and LumaFusion, apt for filmmakers & journalists. However, if you are new to video edit, Filmora will be the best choice for you with all the above features in one tool. Also, we found that Filmora from Wondershare, our recommendation surpasses all others, making it the smartest pick as best audio ducking software.
