_"Can you explain to us the simple method to execute **audio ducking**?”_

I hope you're already aware of **the audio ducking** feature if you're into video editing or any music industry. The audio ducking is commonly to balance two audios. You can see the very typical application while balancing the background music with the person speaking there. So, the different voices would pop up and needs an adjustment according to the scenario.

## Part 1: How to Use Audio Ducking to Fade Out Music in PowerDirector?

**CyberLink PowerDirector** is a video editing software with impeccable features, including Motion Tracking, Magic Movie Wizard, Encoding, Action Camera Tools, and so on. The **audio ducking** element in PowerDirector has automated the audio adjustment in terms of keyframes.

So, let's consider the below steps to **fade out music** or **fade out audio** in PowerDirector audio ducking!

**Step 1: Import Video**

Open the **CyberLink PowerDirector** application, and import the video into the timeline, as shown below. Then, you can also import the background music you'd like to add to the video.

**Step 2: Select Audio Ducking**

Choose the background music and hit the “Audio Ducking” option from the **Tools** tab.

**Step 3: Confirm the Audio Ducking**

A pop-up **audio ducking** window like the below interface will appear to state that PowerDirector will automatically analyze the music.

All you need, is to hit the **OK** button and lend the job to PowerDirector.

Doing so will automatically add the keyframes into the background music you’ve already imported.

So, this was the entire process of **music ducking** keyframes automation in **CyberLink PowerDirector**.

## Part 2: An Alternative Solution to Audio Ducking on Mac

If you’re looking for easiness, you must consider the following section for a suitable alternative!

_“Which **audio ducking** software is the best for Mac?”_

The [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is not only suitable for Mac users but Windows users as well. Here are some of its features on why we used to admire Filmora for easiness and professionalism. Used by vlogger, make-up artists, and professional video editors for tutorials, editing, voice/audio editing, and after effects, Wondershare Filmora is the best choice to give a try today.

* The best part about the Wondershare Filmora is the versatility of audio editing tools.

All in all, the Wondershare Filmora is a remarkable video editor fulfilling the needs of endless people around the globe. It’s usually the first name in mind when it comes to innovation and simplicity.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Here is a step-by-step tutorial after which you can compare the audio ducking easiness of Wondershare Filmora with CyberLink PowerDirector.

**Step 3: Select the Audio Option**

## Unveiling the Epic 15 Rock Melodies that Define 2023'S Music Scene

It wasn't easy getting through 2021\. But the world of rock background music made it a bit easier. This is how 2021 killed the myth that rock ever vanished. Let's check out some of these gems that can create a rock vibe for you to enjoy.

## Top 15 Rock Songs

We have come up with varied songs by singers all around the globe who create a classic rock vibe for listeners with hip hop background music.

### 1\. Ann Wilson, "Black Wing"

Wilson was inspired to write "Black Wing" on birds that are pure flying spirits that connect the threads of nature. You'll experience monstrous drums and power chords. This song uses delicate acoustic strums and a repeating keyboard riff to show contrasts in the world.

### 2\. Tears for Fears, "No Small Thing"

The legends, Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith are best known for the pop hits like "Shout" and "Everybody Wants to Rule the World."

For once in nearly 18 years, the duo taps into a folk-rock sound. It's something new and darker for the band, but it doesn't feel forced. They still represent the previous work that made them what they are today. "No Small Things" proves that even after 40 years of their coming, they still have so much to offer to the world.

### 3\. Rise Against, "Nowhere Generation"

Rise Against speaks for the marginalized people out there through his songs. This title track of their latest album is one of the most poignant songs in their entire catalogue. The lyrics hone in on the idealism of the "American dream" related to a current generation of youths growing up in a world of social, economic and political instability.

### 4\. [As Everything Unfolds - On The Inside (Official Video)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIR9QXRmzAY)

As Everything Unfolds made a sweet blend of mid-2000s emo and modern metal in 2021\. "On the Inside" is a song you get hooked to in all the ways. This anthem gave us all the energy and made the year a little more joyful. Check it out now!

### 5\. [Mastodon - Pain With An Anchor \[Official Audio\]](https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8GeSCV2bZI)

Mastodon made a comeback in 2021 with the much-awaited new album, Hushed and Grim. It kicks off with a rolling, progressive number called "Pain with an Anchor."

### 6\. [The Pretty Reckless - Only Love Can Save Me Now (Official Music Video)](https://youtu.be/hRAdR9ryTbk)

The song comes on Pretty Reckless' latest album, Death by Rock and Roll. It brings hope that life has to go on, and most importantly, is worth living.

### 7\. [Avril Lavigne - Bite Me (Official Video)](https://youtu.be/ciqUEV9F0OY)

Avril Lavigne has mostly made hits in the pop world. "Bite Me" brings her back to some of her pop-punk categories. The song brims with energy and empowering attitude. You are going to listen to it on repeat.

### 8\. [Dorothy - What's Coming To Me](https://youtu.be/WJSEkBx8H%5FM)

Dorothy shifted from a high energy rock' n' roll to sweet, free-spirited music during her first two records. Now she has come up with an even more bouncy high energy track, "What's Coming to Me." The chorus is impressive; her vocals are sharper than ever, and it sounds more mature all around.

### 9\. [ANDREW W.K. - Everybody Sins (Official Video) | Napalm Records](https://youtu.be/Yk8wi4XcQgk)

Andrew W.K. released the album cheeky God Is Partying in 2021, which features the single "Everybody Sins." The track has a catchy guitar sound, yet it is brutally heavy. This makes it an appropriately wild Andrew W.K. song in the best possible fashion. He makes a resignation, and it sounds so great.

### 10\. [Billy Idol - Bitter Taste (Official Music Video)](https://youtu.be/AFj0qmBMBa4)

Billy Idol is known for Punk rock, ‎hard rock‎, ‎glam rock. This track is reflective and redemptive. He vows in the song that "I'm gonna live so hard these broken wings will lift me up to the sun."

### 12\. [Myles Kennedy: "The Ides of March" (OFFICIAL VIDEO)](https://youtu.be/hAD%5F82BD7k4)

Myles Kennedy delivers arguably the most epic title track of his album "The Ides of March". He has fantastic songwriting, instrumental skills and vocal prowess. The song starts with a whisper and soars with power through the chorus. Listeners are taken on a journey with stylistic shifts.

### 13\. [Sleater-Kinney - Worry With You (Official Video)](https://youtu.be/34XX%5Ffg-R%5F4)

### 14\. [Foo Fighters - Waiting On A War (Official Video)](https://youtu.be/CJd82T1%5Fo1A)

 In a melodious voice, Dave Grohl ponders his childhood fears in this thought-provoking song. He shares that his children face the same fears now. He shares his desire for a peaceful existence in a world on the brink of a global conflict.

### 15\. [Jackson Browne "My Cleveland Heart" (Official Video)](https://youtu.be/8%5FgWWzLph24)

In this song, Jackson Browne, a singer-songwriter, imagines a scenario where his actual heartbeat is replaced with an artificial one. "They never break, they don't even beat, and they don't ache / They just plug in and shine". He sings in a sunny tone to mark his words.
