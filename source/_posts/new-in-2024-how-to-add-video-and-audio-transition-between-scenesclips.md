#### 2\. Import video/photos to the project

Before adding video/photo files to the Timeline, you need to import them first into the project. There are mainly 2 ways to import video/photo files: "Import" button on primary windows, or dragging and dropping files from Windows File Explorer to the User's Album. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) supports all popular video/audio/photo formats, including but not limited to AVI, MP4, MOV, MPEG, MPG, FLV, M4V, WMV, TS, MOD, TOD, VOB, MP3, WMA, M4A, JPG, PNG, BMP, and GIF. Then drag and drop the media files from the Media album to the video track on timline for editing

![add transition to video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-editor-main-interface-1.jpg)

#### 3\. Add transitions between video and photo files

All clips will be played one by one without a gap. But no transition effects will be applied by default. To add transitions, switch to Transition tab and drag any transition to the joint of two clips from almost 200 transitions (when the white box appears, release your mouse). Now, you could also add transition at the end or start of a clip.

![filmora add transition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-add-transition.JPG)

You can also change the transition mode among Overlap, Prefix, and Postfix by double-clicking on the transition on timeline

2\. To delete a transition, highlight it and click the Delete button in the toolbar above Timeline, or press Delete key on the keyboard.

#### 4Export video with transitions

When you are happy with your video and transition effects, click "Create" to save the video with transitions. You can save video in all popular formats on the computer by clicking "Format" and choosing a format from the list. If you want to play your video on iPod, iPhone, iPad, click "Device" and select a thumbnail of the device. It's also available to upload your videos to YouTube to share with your friends.

![click the wrench icon on settings button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-1.jpg)

Once you check that you should see the audio waveforms on your clip you can click it again you should see a checkmark and it is highlighted in blue and if you don't want to see them all you have to do is click it again.

![audio waveforms](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-2.jpg)

![adobe premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-3.jpg)

### 2\. Automatic generate audio waveform

Make sure **"Automatic audio waveform creation"** is selected by going to **"Edit > Preferences > Audio"** first. When importing files, no waveforms are generated if option is unticked. Only clips you import moving forward will be impacted by this; clips already imported won't be affected.

Second, for creating audio waveforms on clips that don't have them, select the clips in the Program panel and go to **“Clip > Generate Audio Waveform”**.

![select the clips](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-4.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to add audio waveform animation in Premiere Pro?

If you want to simply add a dynamic effect to your audio, just follow the tutorial below.

##### Step1Click After Effects Composition

First, make sure both the video and audio are selected. Right-click and select replace with **After Effects composition**.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![click after effects composition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-5.jpg)

##### Step2Create a new solid in After Effects

After creating a new project in After Effects, you need to choose a new solid of any color in your composition.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![create a new solid in after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-6.jpg)

##### Step3Open audio waveform effect

Search audio waveform and drag and drop this effect on your solid. The waveform will now respond to the audio in your film if you use the audio layer option for your clip in the effect parameters for your solid change.

![open audio waveform effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-7.jpg)

##### Step4Adjust the audio waveform effect

The position of the waveform on your video can be changed by utilizing the start and end point settings. Make sure the last values for each selections are the same to maintain an even level. Next, you can change the characteristics to give your waveform the desired appearance. Here, I applied some fundamental settings that are effective for singing. Using the two-color picker options and the display options, you may also change the waveform's inner and outer colors.

![adjust the audio waveform effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-8.jpg)

##### Step5Check the animation and export the video

Back in Premiere, you can pick whether you want the traditional analog lines to appear or a more contemporary digital waveform. Your clip will now be replaced with an After Effects composition that is dynamically tied to the audio waveform.

![check the animation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-9.jpg)

## Part 3\. How to change the incorrect audio waveform in Premiere Pro?

These problems typically result from corrupted cache/peak files. If you have cleared the cache from the application. I will recommend cleaning them manually by going to the location specified in **“Preferences > Media Cache”**.

Clean the contents of the folder named Media Cache, Media Cache files, and Peak files (Before cleaning them, please ensure to open these folders once and verify if they have any of the media files in them to avoid any accidental deletion of required media or asset).

![media cache files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-10.jpg)

Please make sure that the option **“Save.cfa and.pek cache files next to the original media files when possible”** is unchecked. If it is ticked, you will have to remove them by hand from the folders where the media files are kept.

![media files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/premiere-pro-audio-waveform-11.jpg)

The Audio previews can also be cleaned **(File > Project Settings > Scratch Disks > Audio Previews).**

The following time you open the project, these files will be cleared. Rebuilding the necessary cache and peak files could take some time.
