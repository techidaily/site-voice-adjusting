##### Pros

Other than the seamless connectivity of AirPods with Apple products, it offers one of the most excellent perks, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). It helps you when you want to focus on anything and want to tune yourself to get yourself out of this world, and then this product can cancel a big amount of noise around you which you can keep ON and OFF according to your need.

All audio control will still work with windows, and it's not compulsory to have an Apple device at another end. For example, clicking on the AirPod will pause and play the music, clicking 2 or 3 times forward and backward, and holding AirPods can switch On and Off the ANC mode.

Audio quality is also a big perk while using AirPods with a PC. The regular AirPods are okay in terms of music experience, but there are 5 stars for AirPods Pro.

Battery life is also an advantage if you are an AirPod user. The battery life of AirPods is good and can last longer when you connect AirPods to PC.

Besides all these perks, people also like the Build and Look of AirPods. Everyone used to talk about it when they were newly launched. Now AirPods are common and also is a "status symbol," it's true, and that's worth it.

##### Cons

With windows, you can use only the basic features of AirPods. AirPods will not work to their full potential, and there are also more features that AirPods offers.

Price is a big disadvantage because you can get Microsoft's Surface Earbuds and Google's Pixel Buds. Both have some perk's that you can not get with AirPods. Some also give preference to them look wise also. And also touch control are also better in Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft's Surface EarBuds.

Wearing AirPods and keeping them in ear's while working or jogging is tricky. AirPods fall off easily. But on the other hand, Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft's Surface EarBuds are easy to handle and comfortable to wear compared to AirPods.

AirPods are build in a way that they can work best with Apple devices. You can face issues if you are using it with windows or any other device other than Apple. For example, Automatic ear detection, Automatic pairing. Music will not automatically pause when you take AirPods out from your ears.

Music controls are features that we can't miss here. You can have only basic controls. You can miss a lot of features like Siri access.
