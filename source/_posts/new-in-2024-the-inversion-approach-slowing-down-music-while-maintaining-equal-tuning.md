### 3Share or save our own creation

 After adding photos to audio, you can save the creation in different ways. In the “Format” tab, you can save the file in any popular media format. If you want the file be played on mobile devices, go to the “Device” tab and choose one of the devices from the list.

 Of course, publish it in social media like Facebook and YouTube is also another good choice if you want to share the video with your friend. To do this, click the “Create” button and go to the “YouTube” tab. Fill in the information and this program will publish your creation to the social media pages - it will be uploaded promptly and properly. You can also burn a DVD and present your family or friends with a beautifully packaged disk.
