For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try AI Voice Changer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

## Part 1\. Best Free Male to Female Voice Changers Online

### 1\. LingoJam

[LingoJam](https://lingojam.com/MaletoFemaleVoiceChanger) is a super-easy online voice changer to a girl. You can record the clip in real-time, directly from the sound recorder provided. It depends on your internet how much time the voice modification can take.

This website is mainly for pitch adjustment, and a higher pitch is the main feature needed for a girl's voice. The purpose of this voice changer is also to benefit those looking for voice therapy. Moreover, you can also upload recorded audio from your device and modify it.

![ change male to female voice with LingoJam](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/male-to-female-voice-changer-online-lingojam.jpg)

Though this one is a male-to-female voice changer online, it also has a version where you can change from female to male. When you have loaded the audio or recorded the voice, you need to tap on the pitch button. This button will open a range of options for you, where you will choose the level of pitch needed. It's an easy-to-use method and comes in handy anytime, anywhere. You can also see some other basic sound effects like chipmunk voice.

PROS:

* Easy to use
* Good for beginners

CONS:

* No effects other than pitch adjustments

### 2\. Voice Changer

[VoiceChanger](https://voicechanger.io/)is another online and free tool to change your voice from male to female pitch. To alter voice to a more feminine one, you need to make the pitch higher. A lower pitch would make the audio heavier. In this girl voice changer online, a vast library of audio effects is available; hence, if you're looking for a voice changer that also offers various fun audio effects, this one's perfect! From robotic to alien voice, this offers all. The audio generation takes a couple of moments, and it depends on the voice you choose. If you choose a complex effect that takes more adjustments, it might take you longer. Below is the screenshot for a quick look at the audio effects:

![   male to female voice changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-voicechanger-io.jpg)

Just as LingoJam, here you can either upload the audio or record one at the moment. This one also offers artificial intelligence as you can use speech text too. Therefore, if you're stuck in traffic on the way home on a boring afternoon, this one's your perfect partner!

PROS:

* Has various audio effects
* Free to use
* Smoothly runs even if you choose complex audio effects

CONS:

* Less popular for the male to female voice modification
* Some audio effects are of low quality

### 3\. Voice Spice Recorder

The [voice spice recorder](https://voicespice.com/) is also online and free, offering you a fun time with friends with multiple options. One setting that might confuse you is that the adjustments have to be made before uploading audio. Meaning, you need to adjust the pitch and other features before you record or upload the audio.
