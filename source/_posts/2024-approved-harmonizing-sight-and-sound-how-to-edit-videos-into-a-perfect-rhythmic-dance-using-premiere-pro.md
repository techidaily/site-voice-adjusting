 A rapid succession of shots can make any music video or a feature film more entertaining to watch. The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.

## How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?

 Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the **New** submenu in the **File menu**.

 Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.

 Click on the **Wrench icon** and choose the **Show Audio Waveform** option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.

 When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the **M keyboard shortcut**, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.

 Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add **In and Out points**, by either clicking on their icons or using the **I and O buttons**, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.

 Choose the **Automate to Sequence** option from the **Clip menu** and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the **Selection Order** option from the **Ordering menu**. Afterward, you should select the **At Unnumbered Markers** setting from the **Placement menu** and change the **Method to the Overwrite Edit.**

 Make sure that the **Use In/Out Range** option is enabled and click on the **Ignore Audio** checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.

## How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?

 Placing markers at each beat in the song can be both difficult and time-consuming, which defeats the purpose of using Adobe Premiere Pro to automate this process. In case you are looking to save some time on adding markers to a sequence, you should try the Mamoworld’s [BeatEdit extension](https://mamoworld.com/tools/beatedit-premiere-pro) for Adobe Premiere Pro that analyses the music and adds markers automatically. Here’s how you can edit video clips to match the beat with BeatEdit.

**How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?**

 In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the **Extensions submenu** that is located in the Window menu.

 After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the **Load Music** button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.

 You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the **Create Markers** button.

 Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin. Place the playhead at the beginning of the timeline and select the Automate to Sequence option from the Clip menu. You can then select the same settings you’d select if you added the markers to the sequence on your own.

**Conclusion**

 Editing videos to the beat of a song in Premiere Pro is becoming increasingly popular among video content creators. Hopefully, our tutorial has helped you learn this simple but effective video editing technique so that you can use it to make the videos your friends and followers on social media are going to enjoy watching. It is important to remember that how effective your beat edits are going to be, depends on the quality of the footage and the song selection.

Besides, we can mix two songs. For example, we can mix the narrator’s words into a song. By this way, listeners can understand the meaning while enjoying the songs.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The quality of sound that you hear depends on various factors, and an appropriate **audio format** is one of them. While each type of acoustic file has its own significance, choosing the best audio format as per the target player, expected audience, and/or supporting videos or images (if any) is something that needs much consideration to offer a flawless listening experience.

With that said, here you will learn about some of the most common sound file types, which among them could be the **best audio format** according to your requirements, and a couple of important points that you must keep in might while picking an extension for your media preparations.

## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

_You may also interest: [YouTube to WAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>_

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

_You may also like: [Best AIFF to MP3 Converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

_Check some of the [best FLAC editor programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

_Check this [MP3 editor and convert video to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) easily._

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

What's the difference between common audio file formats like MP3,  WAV, and FLAC? Watch the video below to learn more.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

_Check some of the [best FLAC editor programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.
