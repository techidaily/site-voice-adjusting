#### 2 Add audio to QuickTime video files

You can click the “Split” icon above the Timeline to split and cut the unwanted part of the files.

Tip: You can also replace the original soundtrack of the QuickTime video file. To do this, just right click the video file and choose “Audio Detach”. Then the audio file will appear on the audio track. Then right click the audio file and choose “Delete” to delete the audio.
