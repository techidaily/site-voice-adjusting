## Quiet the Room with a Boosted Windows Volume - Free Solutions for All Users

# 3 Easy Ways to Booster/Increase Volume on Windows for Free

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

* [Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster](#part1)
* [Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application](#part2)
* [Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin](#part3)
* [Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora](#part4)

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

![select spatial sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg)

3\. Pick the Bass Boost (or any of your profiles) and hit the **Settings** key to make adjustments. This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.

![bass boost settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-bass-boost-settings.jpg)

4\. To get to the Windows **Video Playback** settings, click the **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Video Playback**, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.

![video playback settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg)

5\. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.

![hd color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-hd-color-settings.jpg)

## Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application

Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.

1\. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.

![equalizer application menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg)

2\. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

![select spatial sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg)

3\. Pick the Bass Boost (or any of your profiles) and hit the **Settings** key to make adjustments. This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.

The app’s functional design makes it easy to find and manage podcasts by enabling you to create playback queues effortlessly. **Trimming silence, skipping intros or streaming episodes** without downloading them are just a few among countless options the Pocket Casts app offers.

Moreover, the **Car Play feature** enables you to play audio and video podcasts wherever you go. You can also download podcasts if you want to listen to them while you are offline.

Besides, you can play all episodes on your TV or your sound system using the **Airplay and Chromecast integrations**. The only downside is that you have to **purchase the annual or monthly plan** if you want to use all of the Pocket Casts’ podcasting options.

### 7\. Apple Podcasts

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-podcasts/id525463029)

This is one of the most popular destinations for all iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch owners who listen to podcasts frequently. Apple Podcasts lets you browse through more than 750.000 shows and 20 million episodes that are organized into categories. You can subscribe to any show you find on Apple Podcasts for free, download episodes you like to your Apple devices and listen to them wherever you go.

The platform’s editor recommends the shows based on your browsing history and helps you discover content that you are going to enjoy watching and listening to. Even so, Apple Podcasts lack the tools that enable its users to control the playback speed, skip intros or set timers before they go to sleep.

### 8\. Spotify

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [web-based](https://www.spotify.com/), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/spotify-music-and-podcasts/id324684580), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spotify.music&hl=en)

![Best Podcast Player App - Spotify ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spotify-music-and-podcasts.jpg)

People from all over the world have been using Spotify to enjoy music from virtually any genre ever created. This Swedish-American company has been investing a lot into its podcasting services in the last couple of years.

Today Spotify offers access to podcasters to one of the most massive online audiences. Finding new shows and following the latest episodes your favorite podcasters share on this platform is as easy as discovering a new band. There are thousands of podcasts to browse through on Spotify, and some of them can only be played through this podcast player, either online or on iPhone or Android devices.

### 9\. Overcast

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857?ls=1)

![Best Podcast Player App - Overcast ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/overcast-podcast-player.jpg)

Overcast was launched just five years ago, but today it is **recognized as one of the best podcast player apps for iPhones, iWatches, and iPads.** If you are looking for an app that will shorten the silences in podcasts, normalize the volume of the voices or enable you to adjust the playback speed of the audio files, then Overcast is probably one of your best options.

The app also provides **CarPlay support** and allows you to listen to your favorite podcasts even while you are on the road. However, Overcast contains ads, and you must purchase the Premium version of the app if you want to remove them.

### 10\. Castro

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castro-podcast-player/id1080840241)

![Best Podcast Player App - Castro Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/castro-podcast-player.jpg)

Managing large numbers of episodes with Castro won’t take much more than a few moments of your time. Subscribe to a podcast you like, and all of the latest episodes will land in the New tab. You can then decide if you want to add them to the queue and listen to them while you are driving or on your iPhone.

The free version of the app doesn’t allow you to skip intros, enhance voices or reduce silence, and you must purchase Castro Plus to access these options. Before you decide to install Castro or Castro Plus on your device, you must make sure that the app is compatible with the version of iOS you have.

### 11\. Podbean

**Price:** Free but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id973361050), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.podbean.app.podcast&referrer=utm%5Fsource%3Dpodbean%5Fweb%26utm%5Fcampaign%3Dpb%5Flanding%5Fapp)

![Best Podcast Player App - Podbean Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/podbean-podcast-app-player.jpg)

With the selection of over 50 million episodes, Podbean is easily one of the most versatile podcast player apps on this list. You can search for podcasts based on the topic you are interested in, or browse through different categories, and use the name of the podcast, or the author’s name to find the episode you are looking for.

Podbean is equipped with an **audio recorder** that features a rich selection of audio effects and a versatile set of audio editing tools. Moreover, the app provides support for live audio streaming so you can create or listen to live broadcast directly from your Smartphone.

### 12\. Laughable

**Price:** Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:**[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/laughable/id1078473343), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laughable&hl=en%5FUS)

![Best Podcast Player App - Laughable Podcast Player ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/laughable-podcast-player-app.jpg)

Keeping in touch with the latest trends in the comedy world is going to become easy if you install Laughable on your device.

Besides an impressive collection of comedy podcasts, Laughable also lets you browse through podcasts featuring celebrities like Jordan Peterson, Barak Obama or Oprah. The app is free for just ten days, afterward, you must upgrade to Laughable Insider if you want to have access to all the shows and episodes this podcast player has to offer.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.
