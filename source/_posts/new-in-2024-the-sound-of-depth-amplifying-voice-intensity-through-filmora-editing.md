## **How To Make Your Voice Deeper Naturally?**

**1\. Listen to Yourself**

First of all, you have to think about what you have to work with. Record yourself talking with the app on your phone that records audio. If you do not listen carefully to your voice, you will not know what needs to be fixed.

Take a moment to listen to your voice. Because you're now hearing your voice from an external perspective, it might sound completely different from how you thought it would. You can't always avoid mistakes, but you can learn from them.

Take note of how you sound and accept that this is exactly how you sound. During this exercise, listen carefully as words come out of your mouth, study your pitch, and record your voice so you can review the recording later after you've completed your exercise.

**2\. Relax Your Muscles**

As a consequence of stress, bad posture, and injuries, our muscles are drowning in tension. Our entire lives involve the use of our bodies, which directly affects our muscles and adds a great deal of tension. There are four key areas of our body. If you want to make your voice deeper, then you have to release tension from these four key areas. They include the tongue, jaw, throat, and neck. All these organs play a key role in controlling your voice. So, if you are able to relieve stress from these organs and you are able to relax them, then you can easily make your voice deeper with a little practice.

**3\. Use Your Diaphram**

If you're wondering how to make your voice deeper, you shouldn't use your chest for breathing when we have a whole respiratory system to control. As a rule of thumb, the deeper your voice sounds, the deeper the air you inhale goes. You can direct the air to go just where you want it by adjusting the diaphragm.

As you breathe in, bring your nose to your mouth and push your chest backward while taking deep breaths from your nose. When you exhale, tell yourself your full name as you do so. When you speak, you may feel a vibration. It is now easier for you to produce a deeper voice effect since you have learned how to use your diaphragm.

In the world of professional singing, diaphragmatic breathing is one of the most popular techniques. With it, they can control their voice and position it precisely when they want, to produce deep, low-pitched cries (or even high-pitched cries). When you first start, you won't be able to do it naturally, but you'll be able to do it subconsciously with practice.

**4\. Practice Your Chest Voice**

The magic happens in your chest voice. You can make it sound stronger, deeper, and less nasal with a little control. These exercises will focus on deepening your voice since you're looking for ways to make your voice deeper.

Engage your throat first and then speak normally. You will sound lighter and less confident if you usually speak through your nose, which is not good for a deep voice.

Make a hissing sound while exhaling a deep diaphragmatic breath. Having your voice-controlled right within your lungs will allow you to open up your chest. It would help if you started talking now. You will feel your voice flowing up and out of your mouth via your breath. This is the voice of your chest.

**5\. Hum Like You Mean It**

Humming warms up your voice, making it easier to control. In addition, it unleashes feelings of relaxation throughout your entire body, so your muscles can be relaxed. With Hum, you'll be able to lower your voice pitch, talk deeper, and even make your voice sound deeper in a video. Hold your breath with a deep humming for as long as possible. During this process, your vocal cords will be stretched, and stretched vocal cords always give a voice a deeper tone.

As you breathe in again, point your chin downwards toward your chest. Put your chin up and start humming. Speak now. You will feel intense and deep in your voice.

These are some of the natural ways to make your voice deeper. But the thing is, all of them need a lot of practice, and according to experts, one can also damage his vocal cords when practicing all these techniques. But as we told you earlier, there is an easier way of making your voice deeper which is discussed below.

## Part 3: FAQs

### 1\. How do I mute a video in an editor?

You may mute a video by uploading it or importing it from a website like YouTube. Make sure your video has audio since turning the volume down won't do anything if it doesn't. Use the context menu to choose Mute after right-clicking on the video clip. The audio on the video clip will delete due to this action, but the audio will remain for that particular clip.

### 2\. How do you edit sound on TikTok?

If you choose the scissors symbol with your finger, you'll see a waveform emerge at the bottom of the screen. You may go to the song segment you wish to hear using your finger. From that location, you can see the song's time stamps. You may also control the volume of the sound by using the option "Volume," located at the very bottom of the screen.

### 3\. How do I repair a video muted on TikTok?

In case TikTok muted your video for any reason, you try these two options:

1. Delete the video, reupload it to TikTok, and then add sound to it while editing it so the video may get played. After that, reduce the sound level until it reaches zero, and you will be able to submit the video. You can include any sound in the video.
2. Ensure you do not reupload the exact video. You can use an external video editing tool like Filmora to add effects and cut the video into shorter clips. Once done, try reuploading the video and follow the TikTok guidelines this time.

Adding a sound to your video and lowering the level of that sound to zero is one way to prevent your video from being removed for violating copyright laws.

Whether youâ€™re a professional editor or a beginner hoping for a quality audio video mix, this software will help you achieve it. The different options here offer unique features, and we provided a list of their pros and cons to help you make the ideal decision for you.

[Adobe Audition](https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html)

![adobe audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/audio-video-mixer-1.jpg)

**Compatibility:**Mac and Windows

This is a next-level audio video mixer that we find to be an excellent option for mixing, recording, editing, and restoring files. This mixing software allows you easily record music or podcast for various platforms. In addition, it offers a sharing feature that will enable you to share directly from the platform. Adobe Audition provides two mixing modes: the waveform view and the multitrack view. While the Waveform view is ideal for stereo editing, the multitrack view allows users to edit tracks on a timeline. Luckily Audition enables you to switch between both views whenever you want, so you donâ€™t have to choose one.

One of the impressive features that make Adobe Audition one of the best audio video mixers in 2022 is the ability to remove silence from inactive parts in the audio file. While doing this, you donâ€™t have to lose sync in the file. As a result, it is ideal for podcasts and interview audios. It also features a loudness radar that allows you to analyze submix, single tracks, full mix, and many more according to several broadcast requirements.

Another nice feature we found impressive with Audition is the DeReverb tool that allows you to eliminate or remove reverberations from the audio file. IT efficiently handles short delays and spacious reverbs in your video and audio files. The sound remover tool is another impressive tool that allows you to remove car alarms, errant bumps, paper shuffling, and other unnecessary sounds from your audio and video file. You also gain access to the music remix tool that allows you to cut new versions of songs without necessarily sending them to the remixer.

You can efficiently adjust the songâ€™s target duration to help you get the perfect fit. You can also customize the splices or favor rhythm elements to ensure the beats remain locked when necessary. All the functions available on Adobe Audition are useful for your audio and video mixes.

 Pros

* Strong sound removal, audio restoration, and noise reduction tools
* 100BG cloud storage available for all users
* You can access content and tutorials on how to use the software in the Adobe community
* Various visualization tools
