Robots can’t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, let’s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

| [1 - Amper Music](#1)  | [2 - AIVA](#2)         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [3 - Jukedeck](#3)     | [4 - Ecrett Music](#4) |
| [5 - Melodrive](#5)    | [6 - ORB Composer](#6) |
| [7 - Amadeus Code](#7) | [8 - Humtap](#8)       |
| [9 - Muzeek](#9)       | [10 - Brain.fm](#10)   |

Video editing can be a fun task, but it can also be frustrating and challenging. Adding finishing touches to make it appear better will surely require knowledge and expertise.
