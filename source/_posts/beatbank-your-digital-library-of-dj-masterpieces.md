Are you also on the lookout for electronic background music? Do you want to build a rocking collection without spending much? With the abundance of resources on the internet, DJs have a vast opportunity to discover and download sounds for free. Let’s have a look-

### Streaming Platforms

Many sites have enormous libraries for DJs to create DJ background music. But today, these are replaced by the most fantastic streaming services like Spotify and Apple music.

You can hunt for DJ songs on these, but you'll have to download the files from another service if you do not have a compatible DJ programme. But these days, even these platforms are finding their way into DJ software.

The easier and best way is to explore the playlists that already exist on these apps. This way, you can discover new songs for DJ's based on the listening trends of the audience.

For example, apple music has playlists for nearly every genre, allowing you to keep updated with the latest tunes. Spotify's daily playlists are genre-based, and a fantastic blend of previously listened to songs and new tracks to compliment!
