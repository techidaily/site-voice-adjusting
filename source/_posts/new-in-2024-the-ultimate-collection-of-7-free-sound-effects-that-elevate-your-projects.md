![download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/filmora-box.png)

● First, click on the Import option using the Media Library panel.

● Here, you have to browse, find, and select the music file that you wish to add to your video.

● Once you have selected the right music file, it will be added to the Media Library in Filmora after which you can drag the media file from the Media Library to the timeline audio tracks.

● In case you do not have your own music files, then you can also go to the Filmora media audio library which offers more than 50 free to use music tracks.

● After you have added music of your choice using your preferred method, you can double click on the audio track to adjust its volume, pitch, keyframes, and many other advanced settings.

● At last, export the video in your desired settings to apply music over your video files using Filmora.

### #2) Put Music over Video with iMovie

![music over imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/music-over.png)

Just as you can probably guess by its name, iMovie is a video editor made by Apple which is available on almost all of its devices. This means that you can have a similar editing experience on your iPhone, iPad, iMac, and more. While this software is not ideal for any kind of advanced and large scale video editing projects, it is certainly more than enough for adding music to video files. Despite lacking video effects or other advanced features, you do get basic options like trimming, cutting, cropping, adding music, adding text, and other basic yet important features. Hence, if you want to learn how can I put music over a video on any of your Apple devices for completely free, then you can go through these steps and instructions:

● Since iMovie is available for both mobile devices and computers, we will be first taking a look at adding music on mobile devices and then on computers.

● On your Apple mobile device, you need to press the Add Media button on the iMovie timeline where you need to select Audio and browse from the display list.

● You can then tap on the Add icon next to the music track that you want to add to your videos.

● Finally, move the music track under your video and trip it to your desired length before saving your video in a desired video format along with the music track under it.

### #3) Put Music under video with Premiere Pro

![premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/add-music-pr-2.png)

When compared with other video editors out there, Premiere Pro by Adobe is used for all kinds of large scale products including Hollywood movies and TV shows. This is due to the reason that Adobe Premiere offers every possible feature that you can ever want in a video editor. Even though Adobe Premiere Pro is not free to use, it is still a great option for many users who want to edit videos more than just adding music files. Whether it is advanced video effects, plugins support, automated editing, extensive media support, color grading options, VFX support, compatibility with other Adobe tools, sound design, or anything else, Adobe Premiere Pro offers it all. As a result, if you want to use Premiere Pro for adding music to video files, then it can be done quite easily as described here:

● Even though the user interface of Adobe Premiere Pro can be a little intimidating, adding music in it is still quite easy.

● To start, go to the Media Browser in Adobe Premiere Pro to find and browse your desired music tracks.

● You can then right click on a music track and select Import to get the music track in the media library.

● Finally, you can open the Media Library and drag this music track onto your timeline where it can be moved under any video of your choice.
