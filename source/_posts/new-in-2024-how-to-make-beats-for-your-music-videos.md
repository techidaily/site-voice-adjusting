## Part 2: Best Music Beat-Making Software Alternatives

The diversity and abundance in different video editing projects spurs the development of different video editing software. Apart from Wondershare Filmora, here are some of other beat making apps for Smartphones, Mac and PC computers.

#### 1\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) **($299.99)**

Final Cut Pro allows the user to sync the beats to the video in many ways. Final Cut Pro does not allow direct addition of the beats but the app works in collaboration with the BeatMark X to help you add the beat markers to the audio you choose as the video soundtrack.

The process of adding beats is quite simple. All you have to do is add the music to the timeline. Playback and punch the M key to add a marker on each beat. Then finally lineup the inserted clips.

**Review:** The platform does not allow an automated process for the addition of footage or creating cuts. And the price is not user friendly if you have a tight budget.
