Want a program that can change audio volume so that it won’t be too loud or too quiet? Though many media players or speakers have volume control during playback, it still can be an annoying problem and it takes time to set it. And some downloaded files are rather low to listen to even you raise the volume to the maximum level on the computer. So it's advisable to **normalize the volume** permanently.

![Change Volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-volume.jpg)

Thanks to [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a professional video editing tool that makes it remarkably easy to increase/decrease the audio level to a professional sound. Below I’ll describe how to do this in a few clicks.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Note**: This program is available on both Windows and Mac platforms. Below guide, I’ll take the Windows screenshots. For users who want to adjust the audio volume on Mac, just follow the same steps using [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 1\. Import your media files

After downloaded and installed this increasing volume software, simply drag and drop audio & video files to the primary window. Alternatively, you can click "Import" to browse your file folder and load them all. After that, drag and drop them into the Video Timeline.

Note that almost all video & audio formats supported, including WMV, MOV, AVI, MKV, MP4, MPG, MPEG, MOD, DV, MTS, avchd, M2TS, TS, MP3, MKA, and so on.

![increase volume software](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2\. Change audio volume with ease

When the video file is in place, double click it to reveal the editing panel. This panel contains both video and audio editing. To edit the audio file only, just click the Audio column at the bottom to access the audio editing window. In the voice volume control submenu, move the Volume slidebar left or right to increase or lower down the volume. When you adjust it, you can listen to the real-time audio effect by clicking the play icon.

Just as shown in the image window, you can also set Fade in/fade out, fine-tune the pitch, etc.

![how to change volume](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/change-volume.jpg)

#### 3\. Save the changed audio(video) file

When you're satisfied with the result, simply hit "Create" to save your changed audio(video) file. In the output format window that shows, choose your wanted format to save it on the specified folder on your computer.

Besides export video to your computer, you can export to presets for your device like the iPhone 5, iPad mini, iPod Touch, Xbox 360, PS3, directly upload a video to YouTube, or burn to DVD.

If you choose to create music with the free version of Soundation, you’ll be able to work on up to ten projects, try out over 700 audio effects and loops, and export all your music in low quality. Purchasing the Intro pricing plan will enable you to work on an unlimited number of projects, make live audio recordings, import audio files smaller than 100MB or use an external midi controller. Moreover, opting for any of the annual or monthly subscription plans will allow you to export entire projects and audio files in high resolution from Soundation.

online-music-maker-Text to Speech.jpg

Vocals are often overlooked in contemporary electronic music, but there are so many ways they can be used creatively. The platform lets you turn up to 50000 characters into speech at once, and it also offers several different voices you can choose from. Before you create an audio file you can determine how fast the text is going to be vocalized, so you should try different options and see which one fits your project the best. Text to Speech platform can be used during the process of creating a new song, but the tools it offers are not enough to make an entire song.

#### 8. [Looplabs](https://www.looplabs.com/)

**Price:** Free

![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-Looplabs.jpg)

Music enthusiasts who would like to produce different genres of music online should definitely get familiar with Looplabs, as this online music maker lets its users remix songs or make music from scratch. Besides being one of the best places on the Internet to record music, Looplabs is also a community where you can meet people who like your music or discover artists whose work you admire. The Looplab’s studio features samples for a broad range of music genres and musical instruments, and you can use it to make Electro or Funk music equally effectively.

#### 9. [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/)

**Price:** Free

![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-online-Sequencer.jpg)

This is a perfect tool for developing an idea for a song, as you can create a sequence in just a few minutes. You can choose from Piano, Drums and Guitar categories of instruments or browse through a huge collection of fully customizable preset sequences that is updated on a daily basis. The platform also lets you import MIDI files and work on projects you’ve already started developing or you can export your sequences as MIDI files from the Online Sequencer and edit them with your DAW. Even though Online Sequencer is a useful tool for making music, the features it offers can’t really be compared with those on Soundation or AudioSauna.

#### 10. [Autochords](https://autochords.com/)

**Price:** Free

![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-Autochords.jpg)

Finding new ideas for songs is often more difficult than it sounds, and if you ever face a creative block you should simply head over to Autochords. This platform suggests chord progressions based on the parameters you set, so you just have to select an instrument and the name of the song to set the feel, and the platform will show you the main progression and its alternatives. Rather than being an online music maker, Autochords is more a tool that helps piano and guitar players understand chord progressions better. iPhone and iPad users can download the Autochords app from the App Store for free.
