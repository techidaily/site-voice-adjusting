# How to Create Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac

Keyframing is one of the most vital components in post-production that can be applied to video and audio tracks. For instance, by adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can easily apply properties and values to a specific segment. To do this, you can set up an audio keyframe at the start and another one at the ending of the selected part.

Therefore, with the Premiere Pro keyframe options, you can achieve a gradual flow in your tracks. Without much ado, I’m going to help you set up audio keyframes in Premiere Pro with their vital operations in this post.

## Part 1: How to Add Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?

As I have mentioned, to apply adjustments or properties to a specific point in the audio track, we can use Adobe Premiere keyframes. As of now, there are two kinds of keyframes in Adobe Premiere – Clip Keyframe and Track Keyframe. Before you start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you should know their difference.

* _Clip Keyframes_: This would apply audio effects for the selected clip (like adjusting the volume level). The audio keyframe will only apply to the clip that you have selected and not the entire track.
* _Track Keyframes_: These audio keyframes in Premiere are applied to the entire audio track (they have values like Volume and Mute).

Now when we have covered the basics, let’s learn how to set up audio keyframes in Premiere on your Mac.

**Step 1: Add the Audio Track on Adobe Premiere Pro**

To start with, you can launch Adobe Premiere Pro, go to your Project > Import, and simply load any audio track. You can also drag and drop any audio file to the project as well.

![Import Audio Files in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Once the audio track is added to the project, you can further drag and drop it to the sequence section (timelines) at the bottom.

![Add Audio to Timeline in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-to-timeline-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2: Show Keyframes for the Track**

The application would automatically render different keyframes already present in the track. For this, you need to first select the ribbon of your audio track from the timeline. Now, just right-click on the working area and click on the “Show Audio Keyframes” button from the context menu.

![Show Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-audio-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

If you want, you can also click on the “Show Keyframes” button that is depicted by a radio/circle icon on the timeline.

![Show Keyframes Button in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-keyframes-button-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 3: Work on Audio Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Now, you can view either clip or track keyframes for the track. For this, you can just right-click the keyframe button on the timeline to get different options. Here, you can choose to get Clip or Track keyframes in Premiere Pro. There are options to mute the entire audio or set up its volume under the track option.

![Track Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/track-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Once you have enabled the audio keyframe options in Premiere Pro, you can view keyframes in a highlighted color. You can now take the assistance of the Pen tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select keyframes. This will let you select the starting and ending keyframes in Premiere Pro so that you can easily apply the desired effect to the selected segment.

## Part 2: How to Fade Audio In/Out with Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?

Once you have learned how to use the Adobe Premiere keyframe feature, you can apply all kinds of transitions and effects to a segment. Let’s suppose you wish to implement fade-in or out features for any segment. In this case, we will use the Clip Keyframing option in Premiere Pro to achieve these transitions the way we like.

**Step 1: Get Clip Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Firstly, you can just add any audio track to your Premiere Pro project and drag it to the timeline. You can just click on the show keyframes button to start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro.

If you want, you can just right-click the track, go to the **Show Clip Keyframes** \> **Volume** \> **Level** option. This will show the level of the volume for different keyframes, letting you pick the right segments to fade in and out.

![Show Clip Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-clip-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2: Apply Fade-in or Out options**

Once you have clip keyframes in your track, you can easily do whatever you like. You can use the **Pen** tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select the starting and the ending of the clip.

Now, go to the audio segment from the timeline and simply place the audio level up (to fade-in) or down (to fade-out). You can set the audio levels for different segments the way you like to customize these operations in your audio track.

![Fade In and Out in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-in-out-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Pro Tip: Use Inbuilt Fade In/Out Transitions**

With keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can certainly customize the fade in/out options. Though, if you are running short on time, then you can use its inbuilt features for audio adjustments.

For this, you can just go to its **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** option. To fade-out any clip, select the **Crossfade** \> **Exponential Fade** and simply drag and drop to the location of your choice.

![Crossfade Effects in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crossfade-effects-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

In the same way, you can also go to **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** \> **Crossfade** and choose the “Constant Gain” feature. You can drag and drop the Contact Gain effect on any segment to implement the fade-in effect.

That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to set up audio keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro. Since adding keyframes in Premiere can be done automatically, it would save your time in audio editing and post-production. Mostly, the clip audio keyframing is used in Adobe to customize the sound at any desired segment. Apart from fade-in or out, there are tons of other effects that you can apply to your audio tracks with the help of keyframes. Go ahead and try the Adobe Premiere Pro keyframing feature and let us know about your experience in the comments.

As of now, there are two kinds of keyframes in Adobe Premiere – Clip Keyframe and Track Keyframe. Before you start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you should know their difference.

* _Clip Keyframes_: This would apply audio effects for the selected clip (like adjusting the volume level). The audio keyframe will only apply to the clip that you have selected and not the entire track.
* _Track Keyframes_: These audio keyframes in Premiere are applied to the entire audio track (they have values like Volume and Mute).

Now when we have covered the basics, let’s learn how to set up audio keyframes in Premiere on your Mac.

**Step 1: Add the Audio Track on Adobe Premiere Pro**

To start with, you can launch Adobe Premiere Pro, go to your Project > Import, and simply load any audio track. You can also drag and drop any audio file to the project as well.

Once the audio track is added to the project, you can further drag and drop it to the sequence section (timelines) at the bottom.

**Step 2: Show Keyframes for the Track**

The application would automatically render different keyframes already present in the track. For this, you need to first select the ribbon of your audio track from the timeline. Now, just right-click on the working area and click on the “Show Audio Keyframes” button from the context menu.

![Show Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-audio-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

If you want, you can also click on the “Show Keyframes” button that is depicted by a radio/circle icon on the timeline.

**Step 3: Work on Audio Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Now, you can view either clip or track keyframes for the track. For this, you can just right-click the keyframe button on the timeline to get different options. Here, you can choose to get Clip or Track keyframes in Premiere Pro. There are options to mute the entire audio or set up its volume under the track option.

![Track Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/track-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

Once you have enabled the audio keyframe options in Premiere Pro, you can view keyframes in a highlighted color. You can now take the assistance of the Pen tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select keyframes. This will let you select the starting and ending keyframes in Premiere Pro so that you can easily apply the desired effect to the selected segment.

## Part 2: How to Fade Audio In/Out with Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?

Once you have learned how to use the Adobe Premiere keyframe feature, you can apply all kinds of transitions and effects to a segment. Let’s suppose you wish to implement fade-in or out features for any segment. In this case, we will use the Clip Keyframing option in Premiere Pro to achieve these transitions the way we like.

**Step 1: Get Clip Keyframes in Premiere Pro**

Firstly, you can just add any audio track to your Premiere Pro project and drag it to the timeline. You can just click on the show keyframes button to start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro.

If you want, you can just right-click the track, go to the **Show Clip Keyframes** \> **Volume** \> **Level** option. This will show the level of the volume for different keyframes, letting you pick the right segments to fade in and out.

![Show Clip Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-clip-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Step 2: Apply Fade-in or Out options**

Once you have clip keyframes in your track, you can easily do whatever you like. You can use the **Pen** tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select the starting and the ending of the clip.

Now, go to the audio segment from the timeline and simply place the audio level up (to fade-in) or down (to fade-out). You can set the audio levels for different segments the way you like to customize these operations in your audio track.

![Fade In and Out in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-in-out-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

**Pro Tip: Use Inbuilt Fade In/Out Transitions**

With keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can certainly customize the fade in/out options. Though, if you are running short on time, then you can use its inbuilt features for audio adjustments.

For this, you can just go to its **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** option. To fade-out any clip, select the **Crossfade** \> **Exponential Fade** and simply drag and drop to the location of your choice.

![Crossfade Effects in Adobe Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crossfade-effects-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg)

In the same way, you can also go to **Effects** \> **Audio Transitions** \> **Crossfade** and choose the “Constant Gain” feature. You can drag and drop the Contact Gain effect on any segment to implement the fade-in effect.

That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to set up audio keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro. Since adding keyframes in Premiere can be done automatically, it would save your time in audio editing and post-production. Mostly, the clip audio keyframing is used in Adobe to customize the sound at any desired segment. Apart from fade-in or out, there are tons of other effects that you can apply to your audio tracks with the help of keyframes. Go ahead and try the Adobe Premiere Pro keyframing feature and let us know about your experience in the comments.

## Voice Modulation Mastery: A Guide to Installing and Applying Autotune in Audacity

You might be surprised to learn that audacity's many default audio effects do not include an autotune feature if you have ever had to correct a song's pitch or tuning. Not to worry!. GSnap is a free plugin that lets you use autotune (not to be confused with Auto-Tune) in audacity. On Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux computers, you can autotune and adjust the pitch of recorded files using GSnap.

This article will guide you to download the audacity autotune plugin to your computer and install it. Then you will be able to adjust the pitch of your sounds easily and tune them automatically without any hassle. This is a free download that can be installed in audacity to help you fine-tune your live vocal performance. During vocal pitch correction, it allows audacity to expand its functionality.

## **How Does Auto-tune Works?**

Negative feedback from listeners is a common occurrence for singers. They need to satisfy their audience by giving them their most perfect production numbers. Nevertheless, there are instances when they need the aid of a device to conceal their mistakes or avoid making them. So they lip-sync and autotune their prerecorded songs.

Singers and music producers are not the only ones to use autotune. The most common users are ordinary people who have made music creation a part of their lives. Then how does autotuning operate?

The pitch is raised to the nearest correct tone when a person sings with the key off (out-of-tune). Moreover, the distortion can mask the out-of-tune parts (especially the highest and lowest pitches) in the overall performance.

## **How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?**

### **Step 3**

Find GSnap from the list of downloads and click on it. A new page will open to find a GSnap download link. Once you click on it, a zip file will be downloaded to your pc. Keep in mind that this download will only work for windows. For mac and Linux, there will be a separate download link.

### **Step 4**

Open the downloaded zip file and extract all files in it.

### **Step 5**

There will be two files present in the folder once you have extracted them. Copy the .dll file to the Audacity plugin directory. Find the Audacity folder in the Program Files folder on your computer. Paste your copied file into the plugins subfolder. Your plugins will be added.

If you are using macOS, then open the Applications folder, right-click audacity's icon, and choose "Show Package Contents." Next, open the folders "Contents" and "Extensions."

### **Step 6**

In some cases, you may be asked for the administrator’s permission. All you need to do is click on the “Continue Anyway” button if a dialogue box appears and wait for any undergoing process to complete.

### **Step 7**

Now run the audacity program, and if it is already running, you may need to restart it to recognize the autotune audacity plugin.

### **Step 8**

Try recording a new sound in audacity, or you can also open an existing one from your system.

### **Step 9**

Choose the Add / Remove plugins option from the Effects menu in the menu bar. You can enable GSnap by scrolling down and clicking on Enable. Click OK to continue.

### **Step 10**

GSnap will appear as an effective option under the "Effect" tab in audacity with the new update. Clicking on it will open a window that allows you to tune your audio file automatically.

GSnap has several options and knobs that can be used individually to autotune audio files. Get more information on GSnap's online manual or by experimenting with the options.

## **Final Verdict**

Although it isn't present in audacity, which is the most widely used tool for audio editing but using GSnap, you can get auto tune for audacity now. It is free to download, and in this article, we showed you how you could easily add it to audacity in just a few simple steps.
