The advancements in AI technology have made noise reduction seamless. Although, there are some pre-recording measures one can take to minimize noise.

Places with less population and more nature are noise-free as usual. Book a studio for video or audio recording, as you don't need much effort. They offer pre-arranged setups and space, which also includes noise-canceling equipment.
