 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Robots can’t be creative, right? A number of startups that focus on the development of artificial intelligence that is capable of composing music have proved this statement wrong. AI music composers generate original, copyright-free music you can use in your latest YouTube video or social media video ad. You don’t even have to be a sound designer or a musician to produce soundtracks for your videos with AI Music Composers, because you can upload the music that has already been recorded and create variations of it. So, let’s take a look at what AI music composers have to offer in 2024.

| [1 - Amper Music](#1)  | [2 - AIVA](#2)         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [3 - Jukedeck](#3)     | [4 - Ecrett Music](#4) |
| [5 - Melodrive](#5)    | [6 - ORB Composer](#6) |
| [7 - Amadeus Code](#7) | [8 - Humtap](#8)       |
| [9 - Muzeek](#9)       | [10 - Brain.fm](#10)   |

**Price:** Available upon request

![ AI Music Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-music-composer-Amper-Music.jpg)

Industry professionals know just how frustrating the music licensing process can be. Amper Music is a cloud-based platform designed to simplify the process of creating soundtracks for movies and video games, as it produces AI generated algorithms that help users create music in a variety of music genres. You must first create an account on this platform, in order to be able to use the free version of Amper Music that provides only a limited amount of features. Upgrading to the pro version of Amper Music will enable you to enjoy the full potential of this rapidly growing AI Music Composer.

#### 2. [AIVA](https://www.aiva.ai/)

**Price:** Free version available, subscription plans start from €14 p/month

![ AI Music Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-music-composer-AIVA.jpg)

Since 2016, when AIVA Technologies was founded, its team has worked on developing an AI script that can compose emotional soundtracks for ads, video games, or movies. Soon after, the AI published its first oeuvre titled ‘Opus 1 for Piano Solo and in the subsequent years, AIVA released an album and composed music for a video game. Besides enabling its users to create music from scratch, AIVA can also be used to produce variations of existing songs. The music engine that powers this AI music composer makes the production of corporate or social media videos much easier, as it eliminates the need to go through the music licensing process.

#### 3. Jukedeck

**Price:** Free version available, Pricing plans start from $0.99 per download

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ AI Music Maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-music-composer-Jukedeck.jpg)

The AI music composer developed by the Jukedeck startup resembles the Amper’s music composer because they both rely on neural networks to analyze music data, that is then used by the AI to learn how to compose original music. Each track that is available through this AI music composer can be edited, so you can change its length or its tempo. You can create music with Jukedeck for free if you decide to give all the rights to the AI composer, while both individuals and small businesses can purchase the license to use the song created with Jukedeck for just $0.99.

Note: Jukedeck has been acquired by TikTok, and we are waiting for a new Jukedeck.

![  AI Music Maker ](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ai-music-composer-Orb> Composer.jpg)

You can’t generate music automatically with ORB Composer, because the AI creates music based on your choices. That’s why you need to know at least the basic rules of music composition in order to be able to use the ORB Composer properly. The AI music composer comes bundled with a rich collection of chord progressions, that contains almost all chords used in popular music. This tool is aimed at artists who are interested in experimenting with the possibilities of creating music with artificial intelligence and discovering new styles of music. There are six music templates you can choose from, and you can create compositions by simply organizing different blocks of music.

A team of scientists, musicians and engineers uses artificial intelligence to generate music designed to make your brain more productive and focused. They claim that the music created with their AI music composer achieve its effects in just ten to fifteen minutes. However, you can’t use Brain.fm to create your own music, as this platform is better suited for people who spend a lot of time at work and have a tough time maintaining their focus while performing important tasks.

**Conclusion**

The opportunities AI music composers offer are still not properly explored, because most of these technologies are still under development. The results AI music composers we included in this article have managed to achieve so far are impressive because each of them can produce high-quality audio files for all sorts of video content. Which AI music composer do you like to use the most? Leave a comment, and let us know.
