### **Step 2**: Add background music to the video

Drag the imported video files from the album to the tracks on the Timeline one by one. Make sure that they are arranged according to the play order and without overlapping. Then drag and drop the music files to the track above the video track. Now you can trim it and adjust the position to fit for your video length.

One of the benefits of using background music with Filmora is that there is a royalty-free Audio library that provides different genres of background music and sound effects.

Click the music thumbnail in the Media pane, and then drag and drop it to the track in the timeline pane.
