 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The process of making a video has always been painstakingly long, and even though digital cameras and video editing apps that emerged in the last couple of decades have made this process somewhat easier, creating captions for videos you share online is still a time-consuming endeavor. Accessibility and better retrievability by search engines are among the most common reasons why video content producers choose to add captions to the videos they share on social media and video hosting platforms. If you are looking for a way to save some time on creating subtitles for your videos you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best speech to text platforms that enable you to generate captions in just a few minutes.

## Converting Audio to Text

Before we proceed any further we would like to note that the platforms and apps we featured in this article can only help you generate a subtitle file and that you are going to have to use a video editing software or an online subtitling platform to add that file to a video. Here are some of the best options for converting audio to text in 2024\.

#### 1. [IBM Watson Speech to Text](https://speech-to-text-demo.ng.bluemix.net/)

**Price:** Free trial, different subscription plans available

Watson was initially created to answer questions on a popular quiz show called Jeopardy, and over time IBM developed a cloud-based version of the software that turns audio into text. The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.

Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.

#### 2. [Sonix](https://sonix.ai/)

**Price:** Free trial, subscription plans start from $17.25 per month

This feature-rich platform is designed to help storytellers tell their stories. You can either upload audio or a video file and Sonix will generate a transcript of it in a remarkably short period of time, so you can transcribe a 30-minute audio file in less than five minutes. Transcriptions Sonix generates are not always a hundred percent accurate, but you can edit each word that this speech to text platform has generated in its Audio-Text editor.

Moreover, the platform is equipped with a video player so you can see your videos next to the transcript, which can be quite useful if you are trying to correct the misspellings and other mistakes. The best part is that Sonix has Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition integration, so you can add markers, metadata, captions or make rough cuts on both audio and video files you use in your projects.

#### 3. [Amber Script](https://www.amberscript.com/en)

**Price:** Free trial available, subscription plans start at $6 per hour of uploaded audio

Regardless of the pricing plan you choose, Amber Script lets you create text from audio files in 29 different languages. In addition, some pricing plans allow you to create text from both audio and video files, so you can easily make subtitles for your videos. Simply upload the file to Amber Script and the platform will generate the text for you. The text may not be entirely accurate, but you can easily make all corrections from the Amber Script’s text editor that offers speaker distinction and timestamp features. In case you don’t want to edit the text by yourself, you can choose a subscription plan that guarantees a 100% accuracy, as well as other advanced options. You can export the text in a variety of file formats, including commonly used text file formats such as SRT, json or docx, and use it for a wide array of purposes just minutes after you’ve transformed an audio file into text.

#### 4. [360Converter](https://www.360converter.com/conversion/video2TextConversion)

**Price:** Free

This free online converter lets you turn YouTube or any other type of video or audio file to text for free. You can upload a file directly from your computer, use a video’s URL if it is stored online or import it from personal cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Currently, you can only transcribe video and audio files that are in English, French, Hindi and Chinese languages which can limit your options if the text you’d like to generate is in another language. Keep in mind that you are going to have to specify the start and end points of the transcription which allows you to create text from only a portion of the video or audio file. Once the conversion is completed, you will have to wait for your request to be processed before you can download the text the platform generated for you.

#### 5. [Sobolsoft MP3 Speech to Text Converter Software](https://www.sobolsoft.com/convertmp3text/)

All the text the software generates will be displayed in the Results window where you can edit it, copy it to clipboard or save it as a text file. However, this software doesn’t provide support for video files, which means that you can’t use it to transcribe files that are saved in MP4, AVI, MOV or any other of the popular video file formats. You can try the Sobolsoft’s MP3 Speech to Text Converter for free and decide if you want to purchase the license to use the software without any restrictions.

#### 6. [InqScribe](https://www.inqscribe.com/)

#### 7. [GoSubtitle](https://gosubtitle.com/)
