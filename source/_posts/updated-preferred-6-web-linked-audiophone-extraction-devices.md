The growing section is adjustable to match the workflow, and the bottom panel adjusts so that any parameters anywhere on the screen can be seen.

**Pros**

* It features an unlimited number of audio and MIDI tracks
* It is able to host multiple plugin formats

**Cons**

* It doesn't provide all the features at once

### 4\. [LMMS](https://lmms.io/lsp/)

LMMS is a fully free music production software for windows for music development. It is an open-source and also a project platform for the community. LMMS is a cross-platform device app. It makes it easier to manufacture beats, particularly when many music production professionals have to manufacture quality music with their computers.

Thanks to the powerful sample, beat and melody design, mixing and synthetic sound processes, and many other features, the LMMS music production software provides high-quality audio output. The product also features playback tools, plugins, and samples to produce powerful, high-quality sound.

**Pros**

* It is compatible with Linux, Windows, and Mac
* Hydrogen project files and MIDI can be imported easily for editing

* It eats a lot of memory and requires a high-end device to support it
* Some users complained that understanding its working is difficult

![LMMS](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/LMMS.jpg)

### 5\. [Cakewalk](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk)

This is an exciting app for music production to purchase. It is a fantastic tech to invest in music production. Cakewalk Sonar Artist Software is one of Cakewalk Sonar Artist 's great productions.
