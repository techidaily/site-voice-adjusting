Now, with a step-by-step tutorial, let's check how to add and change the voice in Filmora.

#### Step 1: Add voiceover or add videos

Wondershare Filmora allows you to change the voice of video/audio and recorded voiceover. You can either click "Import" on the primary windows to import video/audio files to the User's Album or click the voiceover button above Timeline to record your own voice. The imported video/audio files could then be added to the Timeline for editing, while the recorded audio would automatically appear on the Audio track.

You will open the editing panel whenever you double-click on the added video/audio or recorded voiceover on the Timeline. You should see options such as Speed, Volume, Fade in, Fade out and Pitch.

#### Step 2: Change Voice by Changing Pitch Option

Both video/audio files and voiceover on the Timeline have the Pitch option. You could easily change the voice of video or reca orded voiceover through it. Just drag the little triangle button to the desired position. The value will vary from -12 to 12.
