## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps

You can save Podcasts to your computer from Podcast manager apps. Various Podcast manager apps, such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Podcast, and many others, allow such an operation. However, it is important to note that some podcast managers require a premium subscription to be able to download podcasts.

For example, if you're using a Windows computer, you can use iTunes to download Podcasts. While Mac users can use Apple Podcasts. The steps below allow you to save Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify;

Step1 Install the Spotify app on your PC or Mac.

Step2 Open the Spotify app and login to your account.

Step3 Locate the Podcast show you wish to download.

Step4 Move your cursor over the Podcast episodes and click the download button to download them to your computer.

The backward of using Podcast manager apps is that it can only save your Podcast in the manager app. If you uninstall the app accidentally, you lose access to the saved Podcast because it won't be available on your PC.
