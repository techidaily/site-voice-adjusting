* Fast Processing Ability: Unlike other video editors that take ages to process the videos after editing, Filmora is super-fast. It renders the videos quickly, and also shows a preview of the project before you finalize your video.
* Supports Various File Formats: Filmora supports a wide range of file formats, including MP3, MP4, WMV, AVI, MKV, F4V, GIF, MPEG-2 and WEBM amongst others, preventing you from the headache of converting your videos into supportable formats.
* Split Screen Functionality: This is a highly useful feature that comes in handy when you have multiple videos on your hands that you can play at the same time. You just need to select the split-screen icon on the home menu, and select as many numbers of screens you want, and in any particular order you need.
