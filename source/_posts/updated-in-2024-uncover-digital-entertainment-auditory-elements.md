## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows-Don't Miss It

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

Normalization is still a useful feature that helps to equalize volume in different files. Let us look at some of the best audio normalizers available in Windows.

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For Win 7 or later (64-bit)

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For macOS 10.12 or later

Wondershare Filmora is a widely used video editing application famous for its extensive video and audio editing features. The Auto Normalization in Filmora is an AI integrated feature that analyses the volume of all the clips you have selected. It then automatically adjusts the volumes to 23.0LUFS, the standard loudness level of European audio programs.

To enable Auto Normalization on Filmora:

Go to the timeline and double click on the audio clip you wish to normalize, and from the window that appears, go to Audio, select Audio Normalization, and tap OK.

The audio will be analyzed and normalized automatically within some time.

### 2\. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

Audacity is a free and open-sourced audio software used on all operating systems. Its simple interface and compatibility across different platforms are the main reasons for its popularity.

The sound normalization feature of audacity can be used to set the peak amplitude of any track. It also allows to equalize the balance of the right and left channels of any stereo tracks.

Open audacity, click on Effect from the top toolbar, and then select Normalize. Three different options will be given for you to apply.

You can remove the DC offset, independently normalize stereo channels or normalize the maximum amplitude to your desired decibel.

### 3\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)
