## Part 3: Ways to Prevent Background Noise While Recording Audios or Videos

Editors like **Audacity background noise** removers help in achieving content perfection. In addition to these tools, creators can take some steps prior to recording. These will help them avoid maximum noise distractions before editing. It will also help the tool in generating efficient results and maximum productivity. This section will elaborate on the ways of preventing background noises:

### 1\. Selecting a Quiet Environment

### 2\. Setting a Qualitied Microphone

When it comes to recording, quality equipment plays a crucial role in its quality. Make sure that the microphone is of a reliable company. In addition, position the microphone closer to your lips for clear audio. This will help in capturing high-quality audio signals and reduce background noise.

### 3\. Acoustic Set-Up

If you want to record professional-grade videos, you can also build an artificial environment. Users can achieve such an environment via soundproofing the recording room. This will make audio free of outside distractions and reverbs echo.

### 4\. Disable Noisy or Electrical Machinery

Another way of reducing sound is to minimize the presence of noisy tech in the surroundings. This includes turning off any electrical equipment near the recorder. Machinery like refrigerators, fans, and air conditioners. This is because sometimes the human ear cannot detect a sound, but microphones can.
