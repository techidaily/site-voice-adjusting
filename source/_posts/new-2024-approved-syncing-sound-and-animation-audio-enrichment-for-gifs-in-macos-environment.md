Our busy lives have made reading a physical book nearly impossible. Although we have enough eBooks on the market, it also requires some effort and time to be invested. Most of the people are bothered by not reading enough.

Maybe that is why we have witnessed tremendous growth of audiobooks in the past three years. And as a result, the development of the audiobook market per year is found to be 30%. That implies the audiobook market is growing almost four times faster than the eBook market.
