## How to Change the Speed of Audio with Video in Filmora

The process to **change audio speed** that also has a video is identical to what is explained in the previous section. The only additional step required in this case is separating the audio track from that of video.

You can learn how to get this done by following the instructions given below:

### Step 1: Import File to Media Window and then Add to Timeline

Use the method explained in **Step 1** of the previous section to import a file to Filmora, drag the media to the timeline, and click **MATCH TO MEDIA** when the **Project Setting** box appears and prompts for confirmation. **Note:** Except for the **Project Setting** box, the rest of the process for adding audio and video files to the timeline is the same.

### Step 2: Separate Audio from Video

Select and then right-click the video track with audio in the timeline, and click **Detach Audio** from the context menu.

![detach audio from video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora9.jpg)

### Step 3: Adjust the Audio Speed

After the audio is detached, you can select the audio track and follow the method explained in the previous section to adjust its speed as needed. As for the video, you can use the trimming and cropping options to adjust its duration and size and export the entire project as explained in **Step 4** of the previous section. **Note:** To export the project as video, all you need to do is, choose a video format like MP4 or something similar to that when on the **Export** box.

## How to Change Audio Speed without Changing Pitch in Audacity for Free

One of the most downloaded, used, and admired applications, Audacity, is an open-source and free audio editing software available for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers in both x32 and x64 variants. The software has all the professionals' tools for basic to advanced sound editing to produce industry-standard outputs.

You can follow the steps given below to learn how to **change audio speed** with Audacity without changing the pitch of the sound:

* Launch **Audacity**
* Click **File**
* Go to **Import** \> **Audio**

![change audio speed in Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-audio-speed-audacity.jpg)

* Import the audio you want to speed up or slow down
* Press **Ctrl** \+ **A** on the keyboard to select the whole audio track

![change audio speed on audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-audio-tempo-audacity.jpg)

* In the **Percent Change** field, enter a value with or without minus (-) to reduce or increase the tempo of the audio respectively.

![adjust audio speed in Audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-audio-tempo-window-audacity.jpg)

* Click **OK**
* Go to **file**\> **Export**
* Select your preferred option from the submenu to export the modified audio as needed

You may want to **slow down or speed up audio** if the existing one is not up to the mark, and you wish to manage the ambiance with the help of the music track either while playing a video or when merely a soundtrack is to be played during some event. In either case, the best tool for all your needs is Wondershare Filmora, and if you are looking for a program dedicated to audio only, Audacity is something worth trying.
