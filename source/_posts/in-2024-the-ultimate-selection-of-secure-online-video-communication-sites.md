There are so many platforms that provide its users with the ability to connect, chat and make new friends such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. But there is another platform that is totally different from all these which is known as Omegle. It has the same features as other social media platforms, but the best thing about Omegle is its feature of connecting with others anonymously. It helps you chat through text messages and video calls with other users without letting them know your identity and personal information. It allows you to talk to random people throughout the world without the fear of being exposed or leaking your information. But with the passage of time, Omegle has become an overpopulated platform and it has lost the original feel of connecting with other people and making friends. People now are more concerned about other things than making friends and chatting. But there is no need to worry, there are various Omegle alternatives available on the internet that will provide you with the same experience and feeling. Being abundant in number, it is very difficult to choose the best site. In this article, we are going to share with you the Top 10 Omegle alternatives with the same features and options. Some of these platforms contain more advanced features than Omegle, we have tried to select only those platforms that provide something more or at least the same as Omegle.

### Audio Editor: [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/) (Free)

This editor handles uncompressed audio and supports many files, including AIFF, .WAV, MP2/3.FLAC and .OGG. You can record from different inputs, employ the JACK Audio feature, monitor the volume, and add several different effects.

The good news is that this editing software is simple, straightforward, and will work for many consumers who create their own broadcasts. However, it is rather limited when recording audio from your computer itself, and you’ll need to add SoundFlower to accomplish that.

### Audio Editor:[WavePad](http://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/) ($50)

This is one of the more celebrated audio editing software systems for Mac computers. It contains many tools and sound effects and supports a considerable number of file types. The main attribute may be how user-friendly the wavepad sound editor is and the number of different features.

The only substantial negative is that the floating toolbars used will get in the way when you are working on larger projects. However, a big positive is that this editing system can clean up old, hissy audio quite well, substantially improving your recordings.
