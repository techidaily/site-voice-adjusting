## Top 10 Online Platforms for Sourcing Professional-Quality Montage Tracks

In music, montage is a technique whereby newly branded compositions or sound objects, such as songs, are created from montage or collage. We will give you all the information you need to know before going for a montage music download. We will also highlight where you can get music tracks to add to your montage video.

## Things to Be Aware of Before Downloading Montage Music

Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:

#### 1\. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device

Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.

If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.

#### 2\. The Safety of Your Device

When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.

Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.

Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.

#### 3\. Internet Connectivity

You'll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.

If you download montage music using a phone contract, there's a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.

If you've got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.

#### 4\. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music

When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.

Before you download any montage music online, read the download site's terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.

#### 5\. The Quality of the Montage Music File

Some montage music files you'll find online are of low quality. And this can affect your audience's listening experience. Before you get any downloadable montage music, check its quality.

## Top 10 Websites to Download Montage Music

All loaded files will display as thumbnails in the file tray. Doubling click them, you can preview it in the right screen window.

### 2\. Remove audio from video

![remove audio from video](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-time-line.jpg "remove audio from video")

Drag video from file tray to the Video Timeline. Right-click it and select "Audio Detach." Immediately, you'll see a separate audio file in the Music Timeline. Yes, this is the audio track of your original video. Now just hit "Delete" on the keyboard to remove the audio.

**Tips**:
1\. The files on Video Timeline will be merged seamlessly together by default. If you have multiple files to remove audio and need to save to separate files, please click the left top program icon and save to different project files first. After that, load the project file again and export the output file one by one.  
2\. You can also use the "Mute" option to remove the audio from the video, but you won't get the audio track with this option.

### 3\. Save the video

![remove audio from video file](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/output.jpg "remove audio from video file")

Double click the file in Video Timeline to check if this is what you want. If necessary, you can add some music files that fit this video. Or directly click "Create" to export only the video track. Pick your wanted format to save it on your computer in the pop-up format window.
