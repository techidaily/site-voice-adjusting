## Part 5 How to Add Music from Sound Library to My Video?

Now that you have downloaded your desired music for your video, the question arises, how to integrate it into your video?

A straightforward answer to that can be, using YouTube Studio’s built-in video editor. But considering the limited features it has on offer, you might require something that can allow you to add premium features: drag and drop special effects, custom animation on the go, and much more.
