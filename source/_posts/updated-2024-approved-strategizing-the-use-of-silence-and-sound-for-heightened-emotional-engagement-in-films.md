## Part 1: How Does Suspense Music Work in Film?

It is crucial to understand how suspense music works in the film, especially for beginners. Most movie makers do not know how to build the tension and drop it. The carefully planned dynamics are your way to great mystery output.

The dynamics of the intense music are used to lower the volume and then burst out the music and reveal the big secret. A perfect balance between tension and revulsion creates a more powerful storyline and impacts the audience.

The first factor, tension, is always built slowly and steadily. The suspense background music is deployed in such a situation. Revulsion, on the other hand, is the next moment. It is when the monster is out of the closet. It is the revelation of the big secret of the movie. If tension is the suspenseful music, the revulsion is where horror music comes over.

The right balance between the two soundtracks will mark the success of your upcoming thriller. If the tension lasts longer, the audience breaks it on their own. It often occurs through a joke or breaking silence. Similarly, if the revulsion cues in soon, there is not enough time to build the fear.

For instance, the Main Theme from "Gravity" establishes volume and tension until the movie's climax is reached. Similarly, "Braveheart" uses extensive crescendos to create an intense thriller aura. Most directors always use dissonance to establish a hype. The film "Planet of the Apes" used a mix of soothing and disturbing tones to make the audience uncomfortable.

In such a situation, you can use metal scraping with creepy laughter. The process will be concluded with a hint of echo and reverb for a scary vibe. The sound design is yet another way to build fear. The video game known as "Fall Out" used echoing music to leave a creepy impression.

## Part 2: Tips to Better Use Suspense Music to Create Suspenseful Atmosphere to the Film

Are you a filmmaker? Do you own a production house? Or do you wish to create engaging yet horror content?

With the creative industry blooming extensively, the competition between different production houses is enhancing. It is important to stay one step ahead by making correct suspense music. The sub-section recommends some tips to establish an intense atmosphere in the scenes.

### Crescendos and False Crescendos

A functional tip to create cinematic suspense is by using crescendos. This suspense music continues to develop until the climax is reached. The intense music is gradually built until a startling scream is heard.

Similarly, the false crescendos come with a twist. Instead of hearing a startling scream or a murder, people hear an uncomfortable silence that reveals nothing. It messes up with the audience big time. Don't you agree?

### Repetition

Repetition is yet another technique to create a promising suspenseful aura. The same bundle of chords is repeated, establishing a rhythmic tension. A predictable pattern emphasizes the song and storyline. Additionally, the sudden chord change can be incorporated to release the hype or create a new phase.

### Dissonance

The sound of two or more inharmonious notes develops a dissonant effect. It makes the audience uncomfortable and sends a creepy vibe down the spine. The process of switching between soothing and mysterious sounds keeps the viewers on edge. The dissonant note pairings are extensively used in horror and video films.

### Dynamics

Dynamics is one of the most practiced tricks in the industry to create the needed effect. For starters, the suspense background music is enhanced. The improved pitch takes the audience towards the anticipation of the climax. After that, the chord progression hits the crescendo. The release and silence are a part of the effective dynamics of a movie.

## The Best Online Destinations Where You Can Download Glitch Sound Effects for Free

There are so many different types of glitches you can add to your videos, and each of them creates a different impression when paired with a different sound. Experimenting with sounds until you find the one that fits the visuals perfectly is probably the best way to make a glitch effect more realistic. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that offer free glitch sound effects.

#### 1. [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/glitches/)

![ZapSplat online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zapsplat-glitches-sound-effect-category.jpg)

ZapSplat is currently one of the largest online sound libraries that offers huge selections of royalty-free music and sound effects. The sound effects are organized by categories so you can browse through Explosion, Industrial or Nature categories while searching for effects you want to use in your video. The Glitches category contains a huge selection of different glitch sound effects that can be downloaded in either mp3 or wav formats. However, you must first create an account and become a Gold member of the ZapSplat community in order to be able to download these effects.

#### 2. [Storyblocks](https://www.audioblocks.com/royalty-free-audio/computer+glitch+sound+effect)

![storyblocks online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyblocks-glitch-sound-effect.jpg)

Besides audio files, you can also find stock photos and videos on this platform, but before you can start downloading files you must first create an account. Moreover, some footage isn’t going to be available unless you choose to purchase a monthly or an annual subscription plan. Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.

#### 3. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/dotY21/packs/16933/)

## The Best Online Destinations Where You Can Download Glitch Sound Effects for Free

There are so many different types of glitches you can add to your videos, and each of them creates a different impression when paired with a different sound. Experimenting with sounds until you find the one that fits the visuals perfectly is probably the best way to make a glitch effect more realistic. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that offer free glitch sound effects.
