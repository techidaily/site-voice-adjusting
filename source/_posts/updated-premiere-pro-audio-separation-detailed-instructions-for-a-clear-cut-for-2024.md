Step 1: Launching Premiere Pro

Open Adobe Premiere Pro. Press 'New Project' from the interface that appears. The default settings are good to go. However, make sure that the output location is appropriate. Hit 'OK.'

Step 4: Exporting Process

Step 1: Importing the Media Files

Launch Premiere Pro from your computer. The interface opens up in seconds. The user is recommended to browse the targeted video with attached audio. Add it to the timeline of the Premiere Pro.
