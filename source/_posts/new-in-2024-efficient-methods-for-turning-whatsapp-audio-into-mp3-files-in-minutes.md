Can you ever guess that WhatsApp supports which audio format?  If it is OPUS, then you are a little closer but still a wrong answer. Yes, OPUS was the supported audio format that once WhatsApp used to store audio files, but you couldn’t play the WhatsApp audio on any other media player or other apps on the device. When it comes to the latest scenario, it is found and spread that WhatsApp supports all audio formats.

## Where are WhatsApp audio files stored?

Once you have downloaded the WhatsApp audio, voice note, or media file, have you ever wondered what the files' location is?

If it is your Android device, you can find the audio files by executing "WhatsApp>Media> WhatsApp Audio." If your device has internal storage, you can find the WhatsApp folder directly in the internal storage, but you can find it in the SD card or external SD storage if it is no.
