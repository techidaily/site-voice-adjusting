If you choose to create music with the free version of Soundation, you’ll be able to work on up to ten projects, try out over 700 audio effects and loops, and export all your music in low quality. Purchasing the Intro pricing plan will enable you to work on an unlimited number of projects, make live audio recordings, import audio files smaller than 100MB or use an external midi controller. Moreover, opting for any of the annual or monthly subscription plans will allow you to export entire projects and audio files in high resolution from Soundation.

online-music-maker-Text to Speech.jpg

Vocals are often overlooked in contemporary electronic music, but there are so many ways they can be used creatively. The platform lets you turn up to 50000 characters into speech at once, and it also offers several different voices you can choose from. Before you create an audio file you can determine how fast the text is going to be vocalized, so you should try different options and see which one fits your project the best. Text to Speech platform can be used during the process of creating a new song, but the tools it offers are not enough to make an entire song.

#### 8. [Looplabs](https://www.looplabs.com/)

**Price:** Free

Music enthusiasts who would like to produce different genres of music online should definitely get familiar with Looplabs, as this online music maker lets its users remix songs or make music from scratch. Besides being one of the best places on the Internet to record music, Looplabs is also a community where you can meet people who like your music or discover artists whose work you admire. The Looplab’s studio features samples for a broad range of music genres and musical instruments, and you can use it to make Electro or Funk music equally effectively.

#### 9. [Online Sequencer](https://onlinesequencer.net/)

**Price:** Free

![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-online-Sequencer.jpg)

This is a perfect tool for developing an idea for a song, as you can create a sequence in just a few minutes. You can choose from Piano, Drums and Guitar categories of instruments or browse through a huge collection of fully customizable preset sequences that is updated on a daily basis. The platform also lets you import MIDI files and work on projects you’ve already started developing or you can export your sequences as MIDI files from the Online Sequencer and edit them with your DAW. Even though Online Sequencer is a useful tool for making music, the features it offers can’t really be compared with those on Soundation or AudioSauna.

#### 10. [Autochords](https://autochords.com/)

**Price:** Free

![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-Autochords.jpg)

Finding new ideas for songs is often more difficult than it sounds, and if you ever face a creative block you should simply head over to Autochords. This platform suggests chord progressions based on the parameters you set, so you just have to select an instrument and the name of the song to set the feel, and the platform will show you the main progression and its alternatives. Rather than being an online music maker, Autochords is more a tool that helps piano and guitar players understand chord progressions better. iPhone and iPad users can download the Autochords app from the App Store for free.
