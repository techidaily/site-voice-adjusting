## Part2: Convert M4A to popular Audio formats to enjoy it on your Android phones

M4A is certainly not the best when it comes to compatibility. If you don’t want to waste your time finding a power app that supports playing m4a files on Android devices, a perfect alternative solution is to convert your M4A music files to commonly seen music format, such as MP3 before enjoying it on your portable devices. MP3 is a rather more popular music format that is supported by most default Android players. Here we will show you how to convert M4A to MP3 by using [Filmora audio editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for free. You can download a free version below:

M4A is a kind of audio format that could produce a better audio quality compared to MP3\. At the same time, it also takes up lesser space in your hard disk.
