Are you a struggling creator? Do you believe in aesthetics?

The section highlights some great and workable ideas on the go. Entry-level beginners and even advanced creators can use them effectively.

### Using Video Filters

The video filters change the outlook of the content altogether. These filters play an effective role in engaging the audience. The animating filters lock in the visuals and positively impact the beholders.

### Adding Animated Effects

The animated effects are eye-pleasing. The aesthetics have to be strong enough to send chills down the spine. The appealing transitions with well-crafted graphics spice up any vlog.

### Aesthetic Background Music

A video or a vlog is incomplete without an aesthetic music background. A workable tip is to access royalty-free music from platforms and use it in videos. The audio can also be recorded for a personal touch.

### Color Palette

The right palette and grading tools improve the mood and amplify the message. It is essential to use high-graded colors with a tint of faded colors to set the stage. The addition of black and white color also sets the tone for the entire output.

### Bottom Line

The audience needs relaxing and soothing videos. After a bad day at work, YouTube videos are the only thing people look forward to.

Its title speaks for itself. There won't be any other activity for two minutes except listening to the waves. The purpose of this website is to test your ability to resist doing nothing. If you touch your keyboard or mouse, you will get a failure message, and the clock will reset again if you do. The majority of people fail several times before they complete the task. It is quite fun and challenging at the same time. While you focus on completing the challenge, you will forget all the worries on your mind.

Taking a quick break of 2 minutes can sometimes be all you need to reset your mind. It's also available as an app (for iOS).

You can play multiplayer piano online. In the end, everyone plays simultaneously, and it's crazy but fun. Both your mouse and keyboard can be used. Also available on the site are the possibilities of starting a chat with some random 'composers' or playing by yourself. If you don't want to play in multiplayer mode, you can switch to solo mode. You can also record the piano that you play and then listen to it. Overall this website is quite fun.
