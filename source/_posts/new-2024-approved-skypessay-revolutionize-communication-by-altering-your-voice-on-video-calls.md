#### 3. [Online File Merger](https://www.filesmerge.com/merge-mp3-files)

However, the maximum size of the audio file you upload can’t be larger than 200MB, and you must upload the files in the same order in which you want them to appear in the output file because the platform doesn’t allow you to rearrange your audio files after you upload them.
