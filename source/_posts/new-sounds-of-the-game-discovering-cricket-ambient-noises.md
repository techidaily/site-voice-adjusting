## Part 1\. What is Google Podcast App?

![google podcast interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-1.jpg)

Google Podcast (formerly Google Play Podcast) is Google's proprietary podcast-listening app. It comes pre-installed on some Android smartphones and all Pixel editions. Even Apple users can install Google Podcasts via the App Store. It's free and lets you discover, stream, and download podcasts.

Google Podcast has already hit 100 million downloads, an indication of its rising popularity both among content creators and users. Users prefer it for its navigable, search-aligned, minimalist interface. And prominent podcast creators are focusing on the app to make their episodes accessible to millions of Android users.

## Part 2: Google Podcasts Features

Compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Blackberry, and ChromeOS, Google Podcast is relatively a novice compared to dedicated podcast services. Still, Google Podcast seamlessly incorporates nearly every feature one needs to listen to podcasts.

Search and Personalized Recommendations

![google podcast search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-2.jpg)

The most significant feature of Google Podcast is its algorithm-based recommendations that connect users with shows that suit their listening habits. As a new user, you might want to explore new topics and taste new concepts, and that's where Google Podcast will impress you. But even more than that, it will automatically recommend suitable podcasts depending on your interest and previous engagements with the platform.

Google Podcast app covers a plethora of podcasts, so you do not have to switch to other platforms to discover something new or topics you love.

Free and Ad-free Experience

![google podcast ad free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-3.jpg)

Google Podcast is completely free in a world where podcast platforms demand high charges for an ad-free and high-quality experience. All you need is a Google account to register and listen to anything available on the platform. In addition, podcast creators have to qualify to Google's standards before submitting the podcast on the forum, ensuring you will listen to the podcast in high quality.

Clean UI

![google podcast interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-4.jpg)

Whether you've used a podcast platform before or not, the Google Podcast platform will seem familiar. Once you sign up, the interface will welcome you with podcasts covering all genres arranged neatly in a grid view for convenience.

In line with simplicity, the Settings option in the Google Platform app is as basic as basic gets. Plus, it allows you to conveniently organize your subscriptions and downloads via the Library tab.

One more thing: although Google Podcast is primarily designed for Android users, its counterparts on other OS, like Apple, Web, and macOS, remain simple and easy to use.

Auto-downloads, Sleep Timer, and Seamless Switch Between Devices

![google podcast downloads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-5.jpg)

Google Podcast automatically downloads the podcasts you love and removes them after you've listened to the particular episodes.

Another significant characteristic of the Google Podcast platform is its intuitiveness. For instance, many podcast platforms do not automatically switch to the next episode, but you do not have to worry about such aspects with Google Podcast. You can also put a sleep timer.

Given that it's available on all primary OS, you can seamlessly switch from one device to another. Not to forget, you can search for the podcasts using Google search or your Voice Assitant.

## Part 3: How Does Google Podcast Work?

Now that you know the Google Podcast app and its features, here's how to use the platform. Assuming you have downloaded the Google Podcast platform on your device and signed in using your Google account, we will now show you how to search and start listening to podcasts on the platform:

##### Step1 Add Your Favorites

![google podcast favorites](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-6.jpg)

Once you register on the Google Podcast platform, the app will ask you to explore popular shows or search for your favorites. Once you click on the Explore option, a new screen with categories listed will be shown in the top menu, like For You, News, Culture, Education, Comedy, Technology, and more. Tap on the categories to view the features of podcasts in each category.

##### Step2 Search Podcasts Manually

![google podcast search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-7.jpg)

Click on the Search icon and then start typing the name of the podcasts you follow to locate them quickly. Next, tap on the desired podcasts from the search results and scroll down to view individual episodes. Finally, you can click the Subscribe button to follow the channel. The Play icon allows you to listen to the episodes.

##### Step3 Controls in the Google Podcast app

![google podcast controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-8.jpg)

Once you play an episode on the Google Podcast platform, you will be taken to full-view mode. The Pause icon allows you to interrupt the episode. Plus, the 10 seconds rewind button allows you to go back and listen to something again.

Whereas the 30 seconds forward button will enable you to jump 30 seconds ahead in the episode, you can use this icon during the introduction or in-episode ads. The Speed icon lets you change the playback speed from 0.5x to 3x.

The "half-moon" icon allows you to set a sleep timer. And the "Info." icon allows you to read about the individual podcasts (if published by the creators). The "ellipsis" icon (three dots) enables you to mark the episode as played, so it will not recommend the particular episode again. And the share button allows you to share the episode with others.

##### Step4 Queues and Downloads menu in the Google Podcast App

![google podcast downloads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-9.jpg)

Once downloaded, you can access them via the three-lined icon from the bottom-right of the interface. Within the Library tab, you will also find the History tab, which allows you to access all the episodes you've previously listened to.

##### Step5 Settings in the Google Podcast platform

For instance, Auto-downloads allow you to control the quality of the downloads and when to download (like over mobile data or Wi-Fi).

Plus, you can choose when to auto-delete the episodes, like after a week, and so on. Other options like Playback allow you to decide whether to Auto-play the next episode or not.

## Part 5: How to Record Your Podcast Show for Google Podcast App?

Google Podcast platform also allows individual creators to upload their podcasts to the platform and share it with the world. Given its popularity and user base, it's one of the best ways to rise in the podcast realm and get that edge over others.

So, if you are interested in creating podcasts, here's how to get started. For recording a podcast, you will have to use a third-party tool like Wondershare Filmora. Unlike Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts does not provide a web studio to create a podcast on the platform.

Google Podcast is a podcasting directory; it does not store any audio files. Instead:

* It would help if you created the podcast somewhere else, like using Wondershare Filmora for recording.
* Upload it or store it in another location, like a Website. Or you can create a podcast-only RSS feed.
* And then submit the RSS feed to the Google Podcast Manager.

So, let's first learn how to record podcasts using Wondershare Filmora.

**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Wondershare's Filmora is one of the best platforms to seamlessly record audio and video podcasts. Its straightforward and self-explanatory user interface allows even novices to record podcasts without going through any learning curve.

Besides recording, Filmora also allows you to edit audio and video. For instance, you will find dedicated toggles to limit background interferences, enhance microphone sound, fade in/out effects, and give access to several such features to create podcasts like a professional. You can also export the audio in the format that Google Podcast requires, like M4A, MP3, OGG, and WAV.

Key Features of Wondershare Filmora

* **AI-based Silence Detection**: remove moments of silence from the podcast with one click.
* **Text to speech**: transcript your text files into speech for the podcast.
* **Speech to Text:** transcribe their voice to subtitles in several languages. It increases accessibility, and users worldwide can understand your podcast seamlessly.
* **Audio Ducking**: Add background music to your podcast and manage the sound levels to create podcasts like professionals.
* **Audio Visualizer**: enhance your podcast episodes through audio-visualizing effects.

## Hot FAQs on the Google Podcast App

Earlier, Google featured podcasts on the Google Play platform (hence the name, Google Play Podcast). However, today Google Play does not feature any podcasts. So, you will have to choose Google Podcast

### 2\. Where did Google Music Podcasts go?

Google shut down Google Music on February 24, 2021\. However, it allowed users to move their podcasts and music files from Google Music to YouTube before that date. So, there's a good chance you can find the earlier podcasts available on Google Music on YouTube.

### 3\. Is Google Podcasts Ad-free?

Yes. Google Podcast app is entirely ad-free, and there is no subscription either. So you might see in-episode promotions that individual creators present, but there are no ads in the Google Podcast app.
