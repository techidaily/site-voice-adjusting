## Part 3 Secret about adding audio to the photo?

If you’re looking to add audio to a photo in a straightforward manner, here's a tip for you than going complex. It’s because the software or programs available are highly problematic when it comes to better understanding. Thus, using the ideal program is the best way out (and a secret)!

We have to admit that customization is quite trendy among the young generation. Customizing a unique album is a cool thing, too.

A professional editing tool would be an ideal helper to do this (hence, the reason you’re here). While a great variety of music management software and video editors support adding audio to images, Wondershare Filmora stands out for its efficiency, simplicity, and robust capability.

To get started, consider a free trial copy of Wondershare Filmora

##### Step1 Import Media

Hit the "Import" tab to load your songs from ripped CDs or downloaded from the internet.

Then drag and drop your image in a format like JPEG, JPG, JPE, GIF, BMP, DIB, PNG, JFIF, TIFF, TIF to the media library panel. Now you'll consider using all the imported files displayed as thumbnails in the Media library.

##### Step2 Drag and Drop to add photos to audio

Drag songs and photos from the Media Library to the Timeline accordingly.

Filmora assists you in adding various photos to the audio. You can highlight the image and hover your mouse to the last section.

Click the "set duration" icon on the toolbar and set it to fit your music file's length.

Tips: You can zoom-out or zoom-in on the Timeline in the top right corner by dragging the timeline slider to find the ideal position easily.

Check the effect in the preview window after this. If possible, you can ramp up your creation, e.g., add captions, apply special effects, transitions, and even create a picture-in-picture effect.

![add audio to photo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-to-audio-timeline.jpg)

##### Step3 Save Music with Photos
