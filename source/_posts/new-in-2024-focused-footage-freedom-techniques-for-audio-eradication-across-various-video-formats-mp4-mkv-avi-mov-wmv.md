This section will elaborate on the ways of preventing background noises:

### 1\. Selecting a Quiet Environment

Before creating videos, ensure that there is minimum sound in the surroundings. Don't shoot in areas with heavy traffic or heavy machine sounds. Choose peaceful places that can add to your video's audio as well as visual quality.

### 2\. Setting a Qualitied Microphone

When it comes to recording, quality equipment plays a crucial role in its quality. Make sure that the microphone is of a reliable company. In addition, position the microphone closer to your lips for clear audio. This will help in capturing high-quality audio signals and reduce background noise.

### 3\. Acoustic Set-Up

If you want to record professional-grade videos, you can also build an artificial environment. Users can achieve such an environment via soundproofing the recording room. This will make audio free of outside distractions and reverbs echo.

### 4\. Disable Noisy or Electrical Machinery

Another way of reducing sound is to minimize the presence of noisy tech in the surroundings. This includes turning off any electrical equipment near the recorder. Machinery like refrigerators, fans, and air conditioners. This is because sometimes the human ear cannot detect a sound, but microphones can.

### 5\. Track and Maintain Audio Levels

## Part 1: Why Is It Necessary to Get Rid of Background Noise in Videos and Audios?

You might wonder, if no one can avoid background noises, why remove them? However, there are many reasons why removing them is significant. Along with achieving high-quality videos, they have many advantages. This section of the **Audacity noise cancellation** article will discuss the reasons below:

### 1\. Effective Communication

If you’re a creator, professional, or marketer, audience communication is important. Digital platforms have eased this through videos and online streamlining platforms. You bring clarity to your speech for effective communication via noise reduction. A video without distractions hooks the viewers to the screen, and they focus better.

### 2\. Reflects Professionalism

Creators with international reach and vast audiences never compromise on audio quality. They post videos with zero background noises and audio enhancement effects. This is because such videos convey a professional brand or creator's image. No one likes a video with distracting traffic noises, wind noises, and others.

### 3\. High Production Value

Video without background noises builds a premium and consistent brand image. They convey a message that the brand cares for its audience's preferences. In addition, the production of such videos speaks for itself. The stakeholders also invest in such brands that care for brand image.

### 4\. Consistent Storytelling

With background noises out of the image, the storyline stays consistent. There are no unnecessary distractions that keep the audience off your videos. Those who create learning tutorials and explainer videos can benefit from this.

### 5\. Audience Accessibility

When creating content, you should keep your horizons vast and diverse. There are people who cannot listen properly and use hearing aids. The removal of background noises makes content accessible for those with disabilities. In addition, some people prefer to watch movies and videos without captions. Background noises will force them to stick to subtitles, which can be a turn-off.
