## The Ultimate Cyber Companion: Downloading Digital Radio Programs to Your PC

Listening to Podcasts is a great way to gather information. Name a topic, and you will find a Podcast on it. You can always count on the best Podcast shows to get quality knowledge.

You can listen to those Podcasts online. But, sometimes, users want to download the Podcast. The reason can be anything; you might want to listen offline. There are various ways to get the job done. We will walk you through different methods to download Podcasts to the computer.

## Can you download a Podcast as a file?

Yes, it's possible. But the process is a bit different for many platforms.

If you're downloading Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify and Apple Play. These apps will save your Podcast in the app's library and make it available for offline listening.

Yet, you can't get access to the saved Podcast on the PC. For this, you need third-party tools to download them to your computer. A step-by-step process of using apps and tools is given below!

But if you're downloading a Podcast from a video platform like YouTube, then yes. You can download it as a file. Here are a few methods to download podcasts. Let's walk you through them one by one.

## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps

You can save Podcasts to your computer from Podcast manager apps. Various Podcast manager apps, such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Podcast, and many others, allow such an operation.

## FAQs

### When you save a Podcast, where does it go?

Saved Podcasts are usually added to the saved list in your Podcast library and will be available for offline listening. But if you want to get access directly on your computer, then you need a third-party tool to download it from the Podcast manager app to your PC, as mentioned above in the article.

### Is listening to a Podcast the same as downloading?

No. Podcast download involves saving a Podcast episode to your Podcast app. But listening to a Podcast refers to the number of times you played a Podcast.

## Final words

You can download the Podcast from a Podcast manager app, an audio recorder, or a video platform. You can also use third-party tools to get directly downloaded Podcasts on your Computer.

Ensure you follow all the steps mentioned above smoothly. Now, enjoy your Podcast with high audio formats wherever you are!
