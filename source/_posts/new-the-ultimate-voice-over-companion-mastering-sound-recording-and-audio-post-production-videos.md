If you are using a video with audio embedded in it, you’d have to detach the audio track from the video by using the simple edit tools provided to you. Now you need to click the Audio Mixer button or double click on the clip to readjust each track's dBm volume, speed, pitch, and panning. You can also trim the audio or apply further effects of your own liking to the soundtrack. While you are working on the track, you can very well check the timely progress of your work.

**Cons of using the usual professional software:**

However, this professional editing software might not be the most suitable tool for you. There are a number of disadvantages of using them.

* Firstly, if you are a computer novice, these tools are never meant for you. Only if you have substantial experience working with computers will you be able to manage and manipulate the tools and achieve intended results. The functions of different built-in instruments and features can appear to be complicated sometimes.
* While working with videos, the usual method is somewhat complex. You’d have to extract the audio from the video file first and then apply that to the editing tools.
* While the work is in progress, checking whether the audio track matches the video is very difficult. To do that, you’d have to wait until the job is done.

Wondershare Filmora is undoubtedly the best alternative you’d find in the market and is certainly more appropriate for you. This easy-to-use software is probably the best tool available to an amateur who wants to mix audio tracks or merge them into video clips with a professional output.

## Why choose Wodershare Filmora to Mix Audio Tracks into One

* Filmora is perfectly compatible to work with any video or audio format. So, you don’t have to convert it first. You need to import the video file and start processing it through the edit tools.
* While editing, it gives you an option to check whether the audio is in total sync with the video you are making.
