Don't you just hate the sound of your own voice? As much as most of us have perfectly pleasant voices, regardless of how they sound when we hear them played back, sometimes we just don't have a good quality voice for video making.

Some people try to get around this by relying on the written word. While that's OK in some situations, it's just not as engaging as a high-quality voiceover. So, what can you do?

Many video makers have found great success in altering their voice ever so slightly. If they have a tendency to garble, slowing things down can help them get their point across better. Similarly, if they have a somewhat squeaky voice, adjusting the tone down a couple of notches can make them appear more authoritative.

Good video editing tools will allow you to play with the speed and pitch of your audio recordings, and not just voices either. Perhaps you want to jazz up a piece of music by playing it faster or add a playful element to your video by cranking the pitch of the music up to chipmunk levels.

Whatever you have in mind, being able to edit the speed and tone of audio in our videos opens up a world of possibilities for voiceover, music and more.

## Adjusting speed and pitch in Adobe Rush

We were excited to see what Adobe had in store for us as soon as they started talking about Rush. Branded a tool for the social media generation, it promised incredible usability, effortless integration with a variety of platforms and all the wonderful editing powers that Adobe are renowned for.

However, there have been more than a few oversights in what Adobe actually produced.

Users have complained that its slow, that rendering takes too long and that the software can be unstable. Worse than that, it seems that a number of key features are missing, such as being able to adjust the speed of video and to change the pitch and speed of audio too.

In short, if you're looking for a way to edit audio to be slower or faster, higher or lower in Adobe Rush, you simply can't. However, there is an alternative.

From the team at Wondershare comes a package known as [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/); an all in one video editing suite designed to do everything you need, and more. Within the capabilities of this software is the ability to edit your audio's pitch and speed, so that you can create the perfect auditory accompaniment to your movies and videos.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to edit audio in Filmora

Using the tools built into Filmora, you can change the pitch and speed of audio in just a few clicks. The function works on all imported audio, whether its attached to the video, recorded separately or is music that you've added to your library.

We'll talk you thorough how to use these editing tools, so that you know you've got an alternative to Adobe Rush.

The easiest way to edit the pitch of the audio in Filmora is to use the edit button on the control panel. Highlight the clip you want to edit, then use the button which features three lines with sliders.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audio-panel-in-filmora9.png)

Clicking this button will open up the edit menu, which allows you to edit video, audio, color and motion. Within the audio edit, you can fade the soundtrack in and out, can alter the pitch and can adjust the volume and equalizer settings too.

Within this menu, a handy tool will allow you to 'remove background noise' also. You can also set audio to fade in or out and can adjust the equalizer to suit the type of audio you're working with.

To change the speed of the audio along with the pictures, you can use the speedometer button above your track. You can also right click the clip and choose 'Speed and duration', or even use the shortcut ctrl+R to open the speed change menu directly.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-audio-speed-filmora9.png)

If you wish to change the speed of the audio without changing the video at all, you'll need to detach the audio from the video clip. This is simple; just right click the clip in question and select 'Detach Audio'. You can now edit the audio independently of the video.

Of course, if you're working on audio which is standalone, e.g. a voiceover or some music you want to play with your video, there's no requirement to detach it from any video clip.

On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll also discover the Audio Mixer, in the button with the musical notes on it. Clicking on this brings up an advanced audio adjuster, which can help you create a better audio quality for your video.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-mixer-filmora9.png)

This allows you to adjust the specific settings of the videos you've uploaded, as well as any additional audio tracks you've added to your project. You can work in stereo or surround sound and can control the direction of all the audio within the mixer.

Wondershare Filmora has managed to not only provide a service Adobe has not, they've made it super easy too. Why don't you try out the free version of Filmora for yourself and see why we recommend this for all your video editing needs.

Are you familiar with audio keyframing? So, what is this audio keyframing? Does this term appear new for you? It won't anymore as we are here to explain. In the world of animation, knowing about keyframes is more critical. Have you ever noticed certain scenes while watching a movie that would reflect different audio volume in other video clips? It is all because of this process of keyframing that allows you to change the parameter values in a video clip. A keyframe on the clip specifies the start and end of the changes that occur in the frames, images, or drawings.

Filmmaking, hand-drawn animation, and short movies are critical applications where keyframing finds the place, especially in changing positions, scaling subjects, and customizing opacity. Although the concept might seem in-depth and confusing, implementing such keyframes isn't a hassle as you think if you have a handy video editor. Today, let's look at one such software, Final Cut Pro X, which is the popular tool for Mac at present in keyframing. With no delay, scroll down to add and edit **audio keyframes** in FCPX at ease.

## Part 1: How to Add Audio Keyframes in Final Cut Pro X?

So, how to precisely **add the Final Cut Pro keyframes**? This session will reveal the answer as we have given a step-by-step guide.

**Step 1:**  Launch and open the Final Cut Pro X software on your Mac device. Select the video clip in the timeline or select a video from the location.

Now, choose “Clip > Show Audio Animation”, or you can also press **Ctrl + A**.

**Step 2:** You will now see various automation options to change the audio of the clips.

To add keyframes, you have to hold or press option-K to create a keyframe on the horizontal effect control that will result in a white diamond depicting the created keyframes.

**Step 3:** Apart from the Audio Animator tool, you can create a Final Cut Pro **audio keyframe** with the range selection tool. To do so, on the video timeline, you need to sue the **keyframe shortcut Final Cut Pro**, which is to hold down R.

Hold the R key down, and on the timeline, click the spot where you need to begin the keyframing, drag the mouse pointer to the area where the keyframing should end. It will mark a range with a diamond.

That is the way you can add a **fcpx audio keyframe**, and is it easy?

## Part 2: How to Modify Audio Keyframes in Final Cut Pro X?

Now that you have successfully created or added **audio keyframes fcpx**, do you wish to adjust or modify them, like changing the volume or any other enhancements? Yes, Final Cut Pro X offers adjustments. Learn how to do it from here.

**Step 1:** Usually, users follow the same way in the keyframe to change the volume per your requirement on the "Volume and Pan" segment.

You can slide the volume pointer as needed, or from the inverted triangle next to the option, you can choose the "Reset Parameter" option to reset the changes.

**Step 2:** You can configure the Pan option of the keyframe and FCPX that offers multiples ones like stereo left/right, basic surround, create space, and so on.

**Step 3:** To adjust the audio animation editor's keyframes, you can drag the diamond to the left/right to change the keyframe position.

If you want to alter the effect's parameter value, you can drag the keyframe up or down.

There is one more option by which you can edit the **final cut pro audio keyframe.** If you click the "Final Cut Pro" option on the top and choose the editing option, it will show you various options to adjust the keyframes like reference waveforms, transitions, etc.

With access to the in-built options offered by Final Cut Pro X, you can easily adjust the created or added **fcpx audio keyframe** at ease.

## Part 3: FAQs about Audio Keyframing in Final Cut Pro X?

**1\. Will changing the "Show reference waveform" checkbox on the editing window's audio aspect affect the fcpx audio keyframe?**

No. A tick over the "Shoe reference waveforms" checkbox will only make changes over the timeline waveform representation. However, no change will occur on the keyframe unless the duration or still images get altered.

**2\. Can I add keyframes across a selected area automatically?**

Yes, with the Range Selection tool's assistance, you can add keyframes over a selected range automatically. To do so, execute the "Clip > Audio Animation > select an effect > disclosure button." From the tools pop-up menu with the mouse icon, choose the option, "Range Selection."

**3\. Despite Audio animation, is there any other option to adjust the fcpx keyframe?**

Yes. To access many different effects in the Final Cut Pro X software, you can change the parameter values of sole keyframes using Audio Inspector.

**4\. Is viewing a single effect at a time in the Audio Animation editor is possible in FCPX?**

Yes. If you have applied multiple effects to a clip and need to preserve a screen space, you can collapse the Audio Animation editor to view one impact at a time. Tapping the "Solo Animation" option from the Click Menu can execute this task.

**5\. Can I delete the created Final Cut Pro audio keyframe?**

Sure. To delete an audio keyframe, select the keyframe, and press the “Shift + Delete” option. Now, navigate to the Audio Inspector, and hit the “Keyframe” button.

## Conclusion

I am sure you are excited to know that working with **the Final Cut Pro keyframe** is easier than you have imagined. Yes, it is, and I hope with the ultimate guide on how to **add keyframe Final Cut Pro X** along with specific FAQs regarding **fcpx audio keyframe**, we have put a full-stop to your queries.

Yes, with the Range Selection tool's assistance, you can add keyframes over a selected range automatically. To do so, execute the "Clip > Audio Animation > select an effect > disclosure button." From the tools pop-up menu with the mouse icon, choose the option, "Range Selection."

**3\. Despite Audio animation, is there any other option to adjust the fcpx keyframe?**

Yes. To access many different effects in the Final Cut Pro X software, you can change the parameter values of sole keyframes using Audio Inspector.

**4\. Is viewing a single effect at a time in the Audio Animation editor is possible in FCPX?**

Yes. If you have applied multiple effects to a clip and need to preserve a screen space, you can collapse the Audio Animation editor to view one impact at a time. Tapping the "Solo Animation" option from the Click Menu can execute this task.

**5\. Can I delete the created Final Cut Pro audio keyframe?**

Sure. To delete an audio keyframe, select the keyframe, and press the “Shift + Delete” option. Now, navigate to the Audio Inspector, and hit the “Keyframe” button.

## Conclusion

Are you familiar with audio keyframing? So, what is this audio keyframing? Does this term appear new for you? It won't anymore as we are here to explain. In the world of animation, knowing about keyframes is more critical. Have you ever noticed certain scenes while watching a movie that would reflect different audio volume in other video clips? It is all because of this process of keyframing that allows you to change the parameter values in a video clip. A keyframe on the clip specifies the start and end of the changes that occur in the frames, images, or drawings.

Filmmaking, hand-drawn animation, and short movies are critical applications where keyframing finds the place, especially in changing positions, scaling subjects, and customizing opacity. Although the concept might seem in-depth and confusing, implementing such keyframes isn't a hassle as you think if you have a handy video editor. Today, let's look at one such software, Final Cut Pro X, which is the popular tool for Mac at present in keyframing. With no delay, scroll down to add and edit **audio keyframes** in FCPX at ease.

## Part 1: How to Add Audio Keyframes in Final Cut Pro X?

So, how to precisely **add the Final Cut Pro keyframes**? This session will reveal the answer as we have given a step-by-step guide.

**Step 1:**  Launch and open the Final Cut Pro X software on your Mac device. Select the video clip in the timeline or select a video from the location.

Now, choose “Clip > Show Audio Animation”, or you can also press **Ctrl + A**.

**Step 2:** You will now see various automation options to change the audio of the clips.

To add keyframes, you have to hold or press option-K to create a keyframe on the horizontal effect control that will result in a white diamond depicting the created keyframes.

**Step 3:** Apart from the Audio Animator tool, you can create a Final Cut Pro **audio keyframe** with the range selection tool. To do so, on the video timeline, you need to sue the **keyframe shortcut Final Cut Pro**, which is to hold down R.

Hold the R key down, and on the timeline, click the spot where you need to begin the keyframing, drag the mouse pointer to the area where the keyframing should end. It will mark a range with a diamond.

That is the way you can add a **fcpx audio keyframe**, and is it easy?

## Part 2: How to Modify Audio Keyframes in Final Cut Pro X?

Now that you have successfully created or added **audio keyframes fcpx**, do you wish to adjust or modify them, like changing the volume or any other enhancements? Yes, Final Cut Pro X offers adjustments. Learn how to do it from here.

**Step 1:** Usually, users follow the same way in the keyframe to change the volume per your requirement on the "Volume and Pan" segment.

You can slide the volume pointer as needed, or from the inverted triangle next to the option, you can choose the "Reset Parameter" option to reset the changes.

**Step 2:** You can configure the Pan option of the keyframe and FCPX that offers multiples ones like stereo left/right, basic surround, create space, and so on.

**Step 3:** To adjust the audio animation editor's keyframes, you can drag the diamond to the left/right to change the keyframe position.

If you want to alter the effect's parameter value, you can drag the keyframe up or down.

There is one more option by which you can edit the **final cut pro audio keyframe.** If you click the "Final Cut Pro" option on the top and choose the editing option, it will show you various options to adjust the keyframes like reference waveforms, transitions, etc.

With access to the in-built options offered by Final Cut Pro X, you can easily adjust the created or added **fcpx audio keyframe** at ease.

## Part 3: FAQs about Audio Keyframing in Final Cut Pro X?

**1\. Will changing the "Show reference waveform" checkbox on the editing window's audio aspect affect the fcpx audio keyframe?**

No. A tick over the "Shoe reference waveforms" checkbox will only make changes over the timeline waveform representation. However, no change will occur on the keyframe unless the duration or still images get altered.
