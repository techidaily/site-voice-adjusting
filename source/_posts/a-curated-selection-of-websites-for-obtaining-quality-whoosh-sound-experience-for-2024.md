 Audio can greatly enhance the quality on the perception of a video – no matter whether it’s a movie, a commercial, or a video presentation. So if all your video is silent, just add video to audio to make it more interesting. With [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can easily add various format video to an audio track in MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file.  
_Free Download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video in a few steps._
