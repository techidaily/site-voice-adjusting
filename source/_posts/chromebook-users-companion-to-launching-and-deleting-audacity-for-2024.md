## "Chromebook Users' Companion to Launching and Deleting Audacity"

Audacity has emerged as one of the greatest free audio editing tools for Mac, Linux, & Windows operating systems. With a wide range of capabilities and quality attributes, it is a basic and straightforward audio editing application. While Audacity for Chromebook and Chrome OS isn’t supported, does it imply you won't be utilizing them in the future? Not at all.

A few simple steps are all that is needed to have Audacity for Chromebook installed on your Chromebook. First, let's have a look at some of the features this device has to offer.

**Features of Audacity for Chromebook**

Audacity offers a wide range of editing features right inside its user-friendly interface, and it won't hold back when it comes to personalization even if it costs nothing. Because it has built-in dithering and is superbly compatible with 32-bit/384kHz audio, it's difficult to ignore this really effective open-source utility. Importing & mixing audio files is a breeze using Audacity, allowing you to combine stereo, mono, and even multitrack recordings. However, it's worth noting that there are now just a few possibilities for the latter.

In addition, Audacity for Chromebook has low system requirements, to the point where it works even if your PC is able to power on. Using this editing program, you may mix and match multiple audio formats and sample rates to create a single, cohesive piece of work. In addition, when it comes to editing, you'll enjoy the unparalleled ease of cutting, copying, and pasting, trimming to the sample level, duplicating, and even adding bespoke fades with the discretely introduced envelope tool.

Audacity seems to have all of the essential impacts. Whether you're looking for preset EQ curves like those found on a telephone or an AM radio, or Bass and Treble improvements, this versatile program has you covered. With the Auto-Duck tool, you may add a voiceover and other essential features to a podcast, such as a compressor, limiter reverb, and phaser reverb. It's an excellent choice if you don't have a lot of extra requirements. Even if you don't use it often, Audacity will be the last piece of editing software you ever buy.

## Installing Audacity for Chromebook

Apps for Chromebooks are often downloaded through the Google Play Store approach. However, sinceAudacity for Chromebook does not support our low-power systems, we must go the other route. To put it another way, you'll have to use Linux to get Audacity.

Linux is pre-installed on most Chromebooks, however, it is still in Beta. Go to the Settings menu and choose Enable from the drop-down menu to use this feature. Please go here for further information on how to enable Linux on your Chromebook. If your device has this wonderful function, you may follow the instructions below to properly install Audacity for Chromebook.

* Open the Linux Terminal in the Launcher.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step1.png)

This is what you'll see when you click on the Terminal.

* To begin installing Audacity, enter the following command in the Terminal window that has already opened.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step2.png)

* If you've done everything correctly up to this point, you'll be able to enjoy the full benefits of the Linux operating system. What follows instead is a bewildering cacophony of bluster.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step3.png)

* It seems that Linux is questioning whether or not you wish to proceed. To respond, use the "y" key on your keyboard.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step4.png)

![install-audacity-chromebook-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step5.png)

## How to Uninstall Audacity

Just like installing it, Audacity can be uninstalled with a few clicks. For this, execute the command below in the Linux Terminal (and you can copy & paste it).

**sudo apt remove audacity**

When this is done on Linux, you'll be asked whether you want to proceed with the uninstalling procedure or not. If you hit "y" the same way as previously, Audacity will be removed from your Chromebook in a matter of seconds.

A screenshot of Audacity in operation is here.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step5.png)

While recording your podcast using the built-in microphone on your Chromebook is a great way to start, it's not the only way to fine-tune the final product. You must drag the track and sound to the center of the screen in order to begin the magic with this program. Once you've done this, you'll be offered a variety of alternatives to get the editing process started.

Using Audacity for multitrack recording & editing is doable, but it's best to use non-linear tools if primary focus is on that element. Apart from that, Audacity is widely regarded as one of the best audio editors on the market.

## Conclusion

Your Chromebook may be able to run a variety of audio recording applications. As with Audacity, you won't be limited in your ability to produce high-quality music with a wide range of unique effects. We also go through Filmora's voice effects & how users may use them to change and improve their voices. Filmora allows you to re-voice video/audio & previously recorded voiceovers. For video/audio & voiceover files, the Pitch option on the Timeline may be used. Change the tone of a video and recording to make it sound different. You can quickly alter the voices in the videos using Filmora. Your viral should be accompanied by a story or a video. Using the Changing Pitch option, you may change the pitch of your voice. You may modify the pace of the video to change your voice (Optional). Make a duplicate of the video or audio that has been altered.

##### Pros

Other than the seamless connectivity of AirPods with Apple products, it offers one of the most excellent perks, Active Noise Cancellation (ANC). It helps you when you want to focus on anything and want to tune yourself to get yourself out of this world, and then this product can cancel a big amount of noise around you which you can keep ON and OFF according to your need.

All audio control will still work with windows, and it's not compulsory to have an Apple device at another end. For example, clicking on the AirPod will pause and play the music, clicking 2 or 3 times forward and backward, and holding AirPods can switch On and Off the ANC mode.

Audio quality is also a big perk while using AirPods with a PC. The regular AirPods are okay in terms of music experience, but there are 5 stars for AirPods Pro.

Battery life is also an advantage if you are an AirPod user. The battery life of AirPods is good and can last longer when you connect AirPods to PC.

Besides all these perks, people also like the Build and Look of AirPods. Everyone used to talk about it when they were newly launched. Now AirPods are common and also is a "status symbol," it's true, and that's worth it.

##### Cons

With windows, you can use only the basic features of AirPods. AirPods will not work to their full potential, and there are also more features that AirPods offers.

Price is a big disadvantage because you can get Microsoft's Surface Earbuds and Google's Pixel Buds. Both have some perk's that you can not get with AirPods. Some also give preference to them look wise also. And also touch control are also better in Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft's Surface EarBuds.

Wearing AirPods and keeping them in ear's while working or jogging is tricky. AirPods fall off easily. But on the other hand, Google Pixel Buds and Microsoft's Surface EarBuds are easy to handle and comfortable to wear compared to AirPods.

AirPods are build in a way that they can work best with Apple devices. You can face issues if you are using it with windows or any other device other than Apple. For example, Automatic ear detection, Automatic pairing. Music will not automatically pause when you take AirPods out from your ears.

Music controls are features that we can't miss here. You can have only basic controls. You can miss a lot of features like Siri access.

If you have genuinely original Apple AirPods, there is no hard rule to use them with iPhone, iMac, or iPad. You can also connect AirPods to PC, e.g., Windows 10.
