### #Convert Audio to Text Free on iOS

If you are using an Apple device and wish to convert audio to text, then the [Dictation](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dictation-speech-to-text/id1124772331) speech to text app is the best choice for you. This application will allow you to dictate, translate and transcribe any texts instead of typing them. All most of all texting applications can be configured to operate with dictation which can be a big saver for you during your busy times.

Some of the features of dictation include 40 dictation and translation languages, audio recording, conversion of recorded files, synchronization with iCloud, easy sharing, etc.

Let’s have a look at how to transcribe audio to text using the Dictation app:

**Step 1:** Open the Dictation application on your Apple store and download it.

**Step 2:** After the installation, open the application.

**Step 3:** Hit the Dictate Button at the bottom to start recording and speak what needs to be recorded.

**Step 4:** After recording hit the same Dictate Button to stop.

**Step 5:** Tap on the Copy tab to copy the text that has been converted or hit on the Send tab to share it via any messaging application.

In this busy world where everything is happening fast, it is very important to keep up. Nowadays, everyone in different instances tends to share information in the form of voice messages. Be it long lectures, product information, briefings, etc. voice recordings are shared very much across the world.

But it is difficult to retrieve information from long audio and hence there is a need to convert audio to text. It is much easier to access information if it's available in text form rather than audio form. It also enables us to selectively access and marks the needed information. Applications like Speechnotes and dictation allow us to record and convert audio to texts. These applications help us to save time for typing as well as in accessing the information later. So if you are having a problem dealing with audio and need to convert audio to text, check out the apps we have suggested above. Thank you.
