A podcast directory is a listening app. It's the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.

## Part 2\. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024

Thankfully, [research conducted by EdisonResearch](https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/) shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories. So this list will help us locate the best podcasting directories. And it can multiply your audience size and quickly reach a more extensive user base.

According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:

![edison podcast metrics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-1.jpg)

You must retain that Edison's research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.

Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it's all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.

### 1\. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.

Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.

![podcast directory youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-2.jpg)

Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create video-based podcasts seamlessly. You can simply convert the video podcasts into an audio format using Filmora itself and then reupload the same Podcast to even audio-based podcast directories.

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 2.5 billion active users.
* **Supported OS**: All major OS and web browsers.

### 2\. [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)

Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.

Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.

![podcast directory spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-3.jpg)

Spotify's personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily/ Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.

It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.

![podcast directory apple podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-4.jpg)

The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.

In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.

However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.

![podcast directory google podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-5.jpg)

Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.

![podcast directory pandora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-6.jpg)

Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.

However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast's team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.

* **User Review of Pandora Podcast**

"Pandora Podcasts recommendations are a blessing for me, who always finds it confusing to locate the right episode to spend my time on."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 64 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

### 6\. [Audible](https://www.audible.com/ep/podcasts?source%5Fcode=BLGORWS0107160001)

Although popular among audiobook lovers, Audible has a considerable podcast following too. Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.

Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there's a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.

![podcast directory audible](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-7.jpg)

It is important to note that both Amazon Music and Audible offer podcasts for entirely free to users, so a more extensive user base prefers these platforms over paid platforms.

* **User Review of NPR One Podcast**

"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

* **Monthly User Base**: 500 thousand
* **Supported OS**: Android, iOS

### 8\. [Tune In](https://tunein.com/)

![podcast directory tunein](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-9.jpg)

Technically, TuneIn is a radio. But lately, it has become prevalent amongst podcast listeners to find their favorite shows and also listen to music. The podcast directory has a global user base of over 75 million and a monthly visit of 7million+, which makes it a great spot for any podcaster to publish their show.

* **User Review of Tune In Podcast**

"I've been using the app for 4 years. I like it, but there are some annoying "features."

1) the screen won't time out when the app is active.

2) the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of "recent" (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.

Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.'

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 7 million active users
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

### 9\. [Podcast Addict](https://podcastaddict.com/)

![podcast directory podcast addict](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-10.jpg)

* **User Review of PodcastAddit**

**"**Been using this for years. It does everything I could ever want when listening/ referencing/ re-listening to my favorite podcasts and a lot more.

I've suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something "exclusive"), but I couldn't stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.

Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you're coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 750 thousand active users.
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated Android App and web presence.

### 10\. [RadioPublic](https://radiopublic.com/)

![podcast directory radiopublic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-11.jpg)

Overall, the RadioPublic podcast directory offers you a smart way to publish your show and grow your audience without going through stress.

* **User Review of RadioPublic**

"Glad I waited a while to find a podcast website provider. Starting from scratch in WordPress seemed too much hassle. Luckily the site came along while I was dithering about what to do.

The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I'm delighted to have chosen this option. Already, my pod site feels "complete" to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 300 Thousand active users
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."
