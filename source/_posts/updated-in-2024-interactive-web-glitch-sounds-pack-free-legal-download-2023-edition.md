All you have to do in order to start downloading effects, images, videos or music is creating an account on Filmstock. Even though you can use this platform for free, there are a few subscription plans you can choose from in case you want to download premium media assets or gain access to the platform’s standard library. Furthermore, the free version of Filmstock doesn’t offer any glitch sound effects, so if you want to download audio effects like Lazer Blast, Static Disturbance or Sci-Fi Glitches you will have to opt for a subscription plan that enables you to gain access to these effects.

Since Filmora V10.5 and later version, the Filmstock stock library has been intergrated into Filmora, which allows you to search the media, effect in Filmora directly without paying first.
