## Mastering Sound Quality on Your Technology

When you use your device for listening to music, default audio profile of your device is just not good enough. This is because a default audio profile makes almost all types of music sound similar and you will never get to listen to the variations they have. That is where an equalizer comes into the scene. An equalizer is basically an audio filter or profile that has a certain setting for the frequencies of sound so that the music you are playing on your device sounds as good as originally recorded.

Whether you listen to music on your smartphone or your computer through speakers or headphones, an equalizer app is a necessity especially if you are an audiophile. That is why we have picked the best sound equalizer apps both for smartphones and computers where there are several music equalizer settings available to choose from.

The extension comes with 21 preset audio profiles that you can set instantly based on the music genre you are playing. Besides, you can customize the 10-band Equalizer as per your requirements.

Most importantly, it does not require heavy resources to run in the background unlike the desktop equalizer applications. The extension is completely free to use. Here are the steps how to use the extension for the best music equalizer settings for Google Chrome.

Step 1: On Google Chrome, visit “<https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/equalizer-for-chrome-brow”>.
