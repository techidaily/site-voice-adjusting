Select an audio file

To put your songs together, you can add two or more files from your PC, Mac, Android or iPhone. It's also possible to upload them from your Dropbox or Google Drive account. Each file can be up to 500 MB for free.

**STEP 2**

Combine MP3 and other audio

If you want, you can add more tracks to merge. Then drag and drop them until you're satisfied with the order. It's possible to convert and crossfade the music file if it's necessary. Take a look at the [how-to guide](https://clideo.com/resources/how-to-merge-audio-files) to understand better how to combine audio files.

## CONCLUSION

Merging audios is combining several audio files into one. We usually select the songs whose styles are similar with each other. Then, we can adjust the playback speed and combine them into a new one. Besides, we can mix two songs. For example, we can mix the narrator’s words into a song. By this way, listeners can understand the meaning while enjoying the songs.
