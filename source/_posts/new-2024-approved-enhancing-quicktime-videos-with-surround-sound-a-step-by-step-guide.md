After you install this video editor, click the shortcut on the desktop to launch it. Then a window will pop up to let your select the aspect ratio between 16:9 and 4:3\. After making your choice, click the “Import” button or drag and drop your QuickTime video & audio files to this program.

#### 2 Add audio to QuickTime video files

After that, place both of the video and audio files to the corresponding tracks of the timeline. Make sure that the lengths of them are approximately the same. If not, you would need to edit the video and or audio streams (for example, deleting unnecessary fragments) in order to make their lengths equal. You can click the “Split” icon above the Timeline to split and cut the unwanted part of the files. After syncing the video and audio files perfectly, you can right click and further adjust the audio file in the editing panel, like changing the playing speed, volume, pitch, etc.

Tip: You can also replace the original soundtrack of the QuickTime video file. To do this, just right click the video file and choose “Audio Detach”. Then the audio file will appear on the audio track. Then right click the audio file and choose “Delete” to delete the audio.
