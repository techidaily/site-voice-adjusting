## **How To Change Your Voice Using Filmora Version 10.5**

In this article, we will discuss three different methods to change your voice in Filmora.

      1. **[Using Tune-up or Tune Down Option](#a)**
      2. **[Using Equilizer Option](#b)**
      3. **[Using Filmora Audio Effects](#c)**

Let's discuss every method one by one in detail and see how you can easily change your voice in Filmora. First of all, make sure that Filmora version 10.5 is installed in your system. If it isn't already installed, you can visit the official website of Wondershare Filmora and download it from there. If you have an older version of Filmora Installed on your system, then you can update it. The best thing about Filmora is that you can download it for free and use all its features without paying anything. The only drawback here is that the final output of your video will have a watermark on it, which you can easily remove by purchasing Filmora.

### **1\. Using Tune-up or Tune Down Option**

**Step1:** Open Filmora and Import your desired video to filmora by going into a file, then clicking on import, and selecting import media files from there.

![tune-up-or-tune-down-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tune-up-or-tune-down-step1.png)

**Step 2:** Now drag and drop the video file to your timeline and double click on it to open the clip settings. You will see different options here; make sure to select the audio to open the audio settings.

**Step3:** From there, you can easily adjust the pitch of your voice. You can either increase or decrease the pitch of your voice, and it will make your voice sound a lot different as compared to your original voice.
