Wondershare is the company that has produced the [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) family of video production and editing apps. Filmora offers software that may be used by various skill levels, from novice to intermediate. A timeline, a preview window, and an effects library are some of the standard elements of Filmora. These features are accessed and controlled by a drag-and-drop user interface.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The Filmora software collection may run on machines running either Windows or macOS operating systems. It is possible to get free product samples to test them out before buying them. On the official Filmora website, you can see pricing choices for each program.

The Filmora Video Editor is easy to use and delivers various features superior to those provided by other video editors. Because of this, it is considered one of the best audio editors to answer **how to** **remove static from audio** and video.

Here is **how to remove static noise from audio** with Filmora.

Step1 Upload Files

Open Wondershare Filmora and load your video into the timeline window. You can get a video preview, cut it up, and remove the bits you don't want to preserve.

Step2 Edit Audio

Select "Edit Audio" by using the context menu after right-clicking the movie in the timeline. You will see four options: silence detection, modify audio, disconnect audio, and mute. Choose the "Audio" option from the drop-down menu if you want to separate the audio from the video.

Step3 Remove Background Static

Double-click on the audio track to eliminate the background noise directly, and pick "normal denoise" from the Edit Panel. You may also double-click the video clip in the timeline to reach the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video. Once there, you can edit the audio and eliminate the noise by clicking on the Audio tab in the Editing panel.

![denoise in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/remove-static-noise-8.jpg)

Step4 Fine Tune and Export

Lastly, with Equalizer, fine-tune the sound to make it more natural. For a better effect, adjust the audio frame by frame until it fits perfectly with the video. After the result, you can click "Export" to save the less noisy video on your PC or directly post it to YouTube or Vimeo.

## Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?

So, that was **how to remove static sound from audio**. But what if you record noise-free audio instead?

If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.

If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn't there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.

Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.

Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.

One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.

## Conclusion

Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem? Video quality is vital, but audio noise can quickly damage your film. However, **removing static sound from audio** may be a pain in the neck. In addition, capturing clear audio may be challenging, particularly in areas with a lot of background noise.

Now you have an audio file with less or no noise and want to learn **how to remove static noise from audio**. With the above suggestions, I hope you'll find eliminating background noise from the video easy. If you want to be more creative in removing **static noise from audio**, try the Filmora video editor to give your mind a boost.
