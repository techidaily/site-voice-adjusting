**Conclusion**

Depending on the frequency of your usage and the size of the media files that you generally process, the **video to audio converter** that you choose may vary. While most online solutions are free but offer limited flexibilities in terms of editing and output preferences, the offline apps need to be installed on your computer and would require local hardware resources to function properly.
