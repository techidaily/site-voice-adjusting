### Step 3: Sharing the Output

Click on the audio to delete it. After that, click on “Share,” located in the top right corner of the interface. Hit “Export File” from the displayed options. You can change the resolution, quality, description, tag, and compress type from the window that pops up.

### Final Thoughts

We are moving in circles. Sometimes we wish to insert music into the video while struggling to remove it some days. Isn’t that life? Therefore, the article featured three background music removers for online, Windows, and Mac. We expect that the procedure will be of great help to you as you mute your video once and for all.
