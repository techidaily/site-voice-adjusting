## Part 5 How to Add Music from Sound Library to My Video?

Now that you have downloaded your desired music for your video, the question arises, how to integrate it into your video?

A straightforward answer to that can be, using YouTube Studio’s built-in video editor. But considering the limited features it has on offer, you might require something that can allow you to add premium features: drag and drop special effects, custom animation on the go, and much more.

So, if you are looking for such features too, then [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the answer to your requirements. Filmora is a video editing software that allows you to perform some of the most crucial editing tasks with relative ease. From integrating music to a video, to adding special effects or custom animation and color matching in your video, Filmora has got you all covered.

### Features

● Adding background music to the video: Music makes everything merry. So, if you want your video to look stunning, you know that music is the key. Hence, Filmora comes with the feature of adding background music/sound to your video that will keep your -audience engaged and entertained throughout it-.

● Audio de-noise: As a content creator, it’s impossible to make sure that there is no noise distraction in the background every time you sit down to record a video. These background noises can be a huge distraction for your viewers and might even annoy them off. Therefore, Filmora has come up with the best de-noise feature to help you reduce the background noises in your video.

● Fade Audio in or out: Like the transition of the scenes in a video, the audio change is equally important. You cannot complete a perfect transition without a proper audio fade. Filmora offers you a more straightforward method to adjust the audio in your video during the transition.

● Beat Detection: Syncing a video has been a hassle for content creators over the years. Beat detection has, however, changed the game completely. In Filmora’s beat detection feature, you can analyze the music and generate beat markers to help you while syncing the audio and special effects.

● Adjust applied audio effects: This is another game-changing feature that helps you lengthen or shorten the length of an impact according to your video. Filmora’s Adjust Audio Effect feature allows you to delay the time of the effect and the factor of effects like echo, lobby, big room etc.

Step by Step Guide for How to Add Music to Video with Filmora:

##### Step 1 Click on the “Import” option to load your original video to the dashboard of Filmora

You can also simply drag and drop your video from the source file. Your added files will be shown in the left media pane.

![import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-to-filmora-1.jpg)

##### Step 2 For adding music to the video(s), simply drag and drop your music over the video track and position it according to the length of the video

One most significant advantage of using Filmora is that it offers you a wide array of royalty-free sounds. To access this feature, you just have to head to the Audio Library in Filmora and drag and drop the music thumbnails you want.

![choose the audio you want](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/select-theme-music.jpg)

If you want to add extra features to your audio track, you can double click on the track to open the editing panel. Here you can edit the add-on features of the audio like fade in and out, adjust volume, tune the pitch, etc.

![adjust audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/audio-ducking-lower-other-clips.png)

##### Step 3 Once done, you just have to click on the “Export” option to procure your video. If you want, you can directly upload the video on YouTube

### Conclusion

Finding the right audio is not enough to create engaging content in today's time. You might find the right kind of audio and even use it properly by remaining within the guidelines of YouTube, but it won’t guarantee success.

And Filmora is the best option out there to create one of the most prolific video content. Filmora is your one-stop destination to deliver the best video content with a wide variety of features to choose from.
