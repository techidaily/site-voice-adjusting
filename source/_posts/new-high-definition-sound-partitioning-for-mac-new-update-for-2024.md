## Part 1\. Recommended Best Audio Splitting Tool: [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Although widely known as the best video editing software for beginners, Wondershare Filmora [video editor for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) also serves as a great audio editing tool. It can split, trim, fade-in or out, change the speed of your audio files, etc.

One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create.

### 1\. [Mp3splt (Mac)](http://mp3splt.sourceforge.net/mp3splt%5Fpage/home.php)

Mp3splt(Mac) is one of the best audio splitter software available. It is open-source software that has the ability to split MP3 and Ogg Vorbis audio files. It is not only useful to split large MP3 files into smaller files or to divide entire albums into individual tracks, but also easy to use. You just need to select a start and end time position.

The best thing about Mp3splt is that it doesn’t decode the file during the splitting process, which avoids loss due to digital degeneration. If you need to split an album, you can manually input the split points and the filenames, or you can get them through CDDB or .CUE files. The audio splitter Mac software also supports automatic silence split that can be utilized to adjust split points as well as supporting ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. It is also available for Windows and Linux users.
