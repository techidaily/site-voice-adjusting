## Part 3 Is YouTube Sound Library Free?

A simple answer to this question is: Yes, YouTube Sound Library is free. The sound or the music you procure from this medium is royalty-free. And using it won’t incur the risk of a copyright strike against your content.

But just like every Google and YouTube tool available on the internet, YouTube Sound Library also comes with a bunch of terms and conditions.

## Part 5 How to Add Music from Sound Library to My Video?

Now that you have downloaded your desired music for your video, the question arises, how to integrate it into your video?
