It allows you to listen to the audio before and after the silence. Then you can decide if you want to do the split at that point. Splitting of the file is done without any loss to the quality because there is no decoding or re-encoding of the audio file during the process. It is compatible with Mac OS X 10.3 and above and supports both Intel Macs and PowerPC.
