## Part 2 Can I use iTunes songs on iMovie

Before we know how to add songs from iTunes iMovie, you must realize that all Music is protected. You will get an error statement that; "the songs you selected are not usable in iMovie because they are DRM (which means Digital Rights Management) protected."

Note that to use the songs you had downloaded from iTunes, you must be sure that they have copyright permission. Otherwise, you won't be able to use such themes in iMovie as those downloaded content through iTunes come up with limited rights only. Available options are:

● Import music from iTunes to iMovie (Already existing, downloaded files)

● Can purchase the track from iTunes Store

● Rip the CD

● Purchase music from Amazon

● Subscribe for the program named ‘Match’ under iTunes (That will assist you in getting duplicate copies of DRM free music.)

Noted: You can use all those tracks you own, but not those tracks that you get on a rental basis (such as from Apple Music).

Alternatively, you have one more option: you can add songs to iMovie from Spotify. If you are willing to learn how to add songs to iMovie from Spotify, the process is quite simple. Firstly transfer your Spotify music/songs to your music library. Then open iMovie > Add media> Add Music and select your desired song/music/track from the library.
