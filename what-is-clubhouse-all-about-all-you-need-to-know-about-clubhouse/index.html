<p>The Clubhouse’s popularity is increasing day by day, and you might have heard about it by now. Many celebrities and influencers are already on it, and you might have heard them talking about their clubhouse conversations in their Instagram stories. In short, you may have heard a lot about this app, and you might be wondering why it is getting so popular. This is because this social media application has developed its reputation in part on exclusivity.</p>
<p>Although celebrities are joining this app, China has blocked it, and investors think this app has billion-dollar potential. The app is now viral these days, and according to some analytics, it got almost 2 Million installs in the first week of February. The app has taken over social media by storm. It is developed by <strong>Paul Davison</strong>, who was an entrepreneur at silicon valley, and <strong>Rohan Seth</strong>, who is an ex-Google employee. The main theme of this application revolves around the audio-chat.</p>
<p>Although it was released in 2020, it recently got a lot of attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his entry on this application. His conversation with the chief of Robinhood Markets, Vladimir Tenev, went viral on this platform, and we saw a sudden spike in the downloads of this application. If you are a regular fork who wants to know what’s going down on this exclusive social media platform and what it actually is, then we are here to guide you. Here is what you need to know about Clubhouse.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Clubhouse"><a href="#What-is-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="What is Clubhouse?"></a><strong>What is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clubhouse-drop-in-audio-chat/id1503133294" >Clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></h2><p>In simple words, Clubhouse is a voice-based social media app where people can interact with each other and do discussions on various topics in chatrooms. It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p>
<p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p>
<p>Different clubhouse niches like song-writers, Entrepreneurs, Counselors, etc., could be an enjoyable way to spend your time. Listening to other people and talking about your problems freely makes you feel really good. It can open many networking opportunities for you, and with a private room option, you can organize an audio-party with your pals. One thing that must be kept in mind is that the conversation does not go outside the application as there is no recording option available, and discussions are not saved.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2><p>![ clubhouse-interface1](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> interface2.png)</p>
<p>The Clubhouse is only available on iOS devices right now. You cannot access it via Android or the web. It is also an invite-only app right now. It means that you need to know an existing clubhouse user if you want to join it. The current clubhouse users need to give access to their entire contact list to the application if they want to invite some of their friends.</p>
<p>If you are already a Twitter or Facebook user, then you should know that clubhouse rooms aren’t entirely free for all. There are some moderators who can freely speak, and they can also allow participants from the audience to speak freely. There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p>
<p>You can follow clubs and people to know when they are participating in rooms and moderating. If you click on the calendar icon, you will get an unfiltered list of rooms happening at that time.

<p>The Clubhouse’s popularity is increasing day by day, and you might have heard about it by now. Many celebrities and influencers are already on it, and you might have heard them talking about their clubhouse conversations in their Instagram stories. In short, you may have heard a lot about this app, and you might be wondering why it is getting so popular. This is because this social media application has developed its reputation in part on exclusivity.</p>
<p>Although celebrities are joining this app, China has blocked it, and investors think this app has billion-dollar potential. The app is now viral these days, and according to some analytics, it got almost 2 Million installs in the first week of February. The app has taken over social media by storm. It is developed by <strong>Paul Davison</strong>, who was an entrepreneur at silicon valley, and <strong>Rohan Seth</strong>, who is an ex-Google employee. The main theme of this application revolves around the audio-chat.</p>
<p>Although it was released in 2020, it recently got a lot of attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his entry on this application. His conversation with the chief of Robinhood Markets, Vladimir Tenev, went viral on this platform, and we saw a sudden spike in the downloads of this application. If you are a regular fork who wants to know what’s going down on this exclusive social media platform and what it actually is, then we are here to guide you. Here is what you need to know about Clubhouse.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Clubhouse-1"><a href="#What-is-Clubhouse-1" class="headerlink" title="What is Clubhouse?"></a><strong>What is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clubhouse-drop-in-audio-chat/id1503133294" >Clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></h2><p>In simple words, Clubhouse is a voice-based social media app where people can interact with each other and do discussions on various topics in chatrooms. It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p>
<p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p>
<p>Different clubhouse niches like song-writers, Entrepreneurs, Counselors, etc., could be an enjoyable way to spend your time. Listening to other people and talking about your problems freely makes you feel really good. It can open many networking opportunities for you, and with a private room option, you can organize an audio-party with your pals. One thing that must be kept in mind is that the conversation does not go outside the application as there is no recording option available, and discussions are not saved.</p>

<p>The Clubhouse is only available on iOS devices right now. You cannot access it via Android or the web. It is also an invite-only app right now. It means that you need to know an existing clubhouse user if you want to join it. The current clubhouse users need to give access to their entire contact list to the application if they want to invite some of their friends.</p>
<p>If you are already a Twitter or Facebook user, then you should know that clubhouse rooms aren’t entirely free for all. There are some moderators who can freely speak, and they can also allow participants from the audience to speak freely. There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p>
<p>You can follow clubs and people to know when they are participating in rooms and moderating. If you click on the calendar icon, you will get an unfiltered list of rooms happening at that time.

It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p>

To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p>

There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p>

<p>MP4 and MP3 sure sound familiar and it’s possible that some may think that MP4 might be the next step for MP3. However that’s not the case. Indeed they are quite different in that MP4, which is short for MPEG-4, is a multimedia container format, used to store audio, and&#x2F;or video data, as well as other data such as subtitles as well as images etc.</p>

There are three types of audio file format:</p>
<ul>

<p>MP3 files are compressed to approximately 1&#x2F;10 the original size of the music file without a corresponding decrease in fidelity and perceived audio quality. Therefore it’s rather small in size, making it very easy to download, transfer and share. Converting MP3 to any other music formats is also possible by using appropriate conversion software programs, so it it easy to conver MP3 to MP4 with a right converter.  </p>
<p>MP4 and MP3 sure sound familiar and it’s possible that some may think that MP4 might be the next step for MP3. However that’s not the case. Indeed they are quite different in that MP4, which is short for MPEG-4, is a multimedia container format, used to store audio, and&#x2F;or video data, as well as other data such as subtitles as well as images etc.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between them is that MP3 can only store audio, whereas MP4 can store multiple formats of multimedia files.</p>
