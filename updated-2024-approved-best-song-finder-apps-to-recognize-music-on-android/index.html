<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021"><a href="#Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021"></a>Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021</h2><p>Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.</p>
<h3 id="1-Google-App"><a href="#1-Google-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Google App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US" >Google App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.</p>
<p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.</p>
<p>This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:</p>
<p>Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.</p>
<p>Step 2- Either click on the “Search a song” button or say “what’s this song?” before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That’s it. That’s all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.</p>
<p>It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, “Hey Google, what’s this song?” before humming the tune, and that’s about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.</p>
<p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p>

<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>

<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021-3"><a href="#Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021"></a>Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021</h2><p>Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.</p>
<h3 id="1-Google-App-3"><a href="#1-Google-App-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Google App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US" >Google App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.</p>
<p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.</p>
<p>This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:</p>
<p>Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.</p>
<p>Step 2- Either click on the “Search a song” button or say “what’s this song?” before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That’s it. That’s all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.</p>
<p>It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, “Hey Google, what’s this song?” before humming the tune, and that’s about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.</p>
<p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p>
