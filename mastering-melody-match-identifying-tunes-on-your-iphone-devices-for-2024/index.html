One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.</p>
<p>You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.</p>
<p>Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:</p>
<p>Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About, and then you will see the software version.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Open Settings&gt; Control Center, and then tap <strong>More</strong> to scroll down.</p>
<p>Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center</p>

                      alt="add music recognition feature to control center"
                ></p>
<p>It is very easy to access and use this music recognition feature. If you have an iPhone that uses facial ID recognition to unlock, then pull down the Control Center shade by swiping down from the top right corner of the phone and tap the music recognition button.</p>

<p>Removing clips will create a gap in the arrangement window that can be filled by dragging forward the remaining clip.</p>
<h3 id="Volume-Adjustments-–-Normalize-3"><a href="#Volume-Adjustments-–-Normalize-3" class="headerlink" title="Volume Adjustments – Normalize"></a>Volume Adjustments – Normalize</h3><p>By double-clicking on the item or by selecting ‘Item Properties’ from a right-click, you can normalize the item. A new window will appear as Media Item Properties, from where you have to locate the Volume Settings and then select the option of Normalize.</p>
<p>If your item is already loud, then nothing will happen, but if it is not, then the slider will change from 0.00 dB showing an increase in the volume. Lastly, hit the ‘Apply’ or ‘OK’ button to imply the changes.</p>
<h3 id="Fade-in-out-3"><a href="#Fade-in-out-3" class="headerlink" title="Fade in&#x2F;out"></a>Fade in&#x2F;out</h3><p>With the Media Properties, you can also adjust a Fade in and a Fade out. For this, you simply have to set an end time for the Fade in, whereas a start time is entered for Fade out. Hit the ‘Ok’ or ‘Apply’ button to apply the changes.</p>
<p>From the Arrangement window, fades can be adjusted. For adjusting the fades, hover with your mouse over the red line. You will see a newly shaped cursor. Just drag on the timeline to play and adjust the Fade with this new cursor.</p>

<h3 id="Automate-Changes-3"><a href="#Automate-Changes-3" class="headerlink" title="Automate Changes"></a>Automate Changes</h3><p>With REAPER, you can also automate changes in track parameters. We will guide about automation from Track Envelopes. From Track Control Panel, hit the Trim option. A new Envelopes window will open at this point from where you have to check the Volume box.</p>
<p>A new Volume Track will open up. Here, you have to set new Envelope points. That could be done by holding the shift key, right-clicking on the point, and then selecting Create New Point. A green circle will indicate the new point.</p>
<p>By dragging the Envelope point, you can also adjust the volume. Dragging it towards the top will increase the volume, whereas dragging it towards the bottom will eventually decrease.</p>

<h3 id="Finalize-the-Audio-–-Render-3"><a href="#Finalize-the-Audio-–-Render-3" class="headerlink" title="Finalize the Audio – Render"></a>Finalize the Audio – Render</h3><p>After all the above steps have been completed to set the order and adjust your desired volume, the last step comes to render your project file. For that, move to the File menu and select the ‘Render’ option. A window will be opened as ‘Render to File.’ Now, from the dropdown menu, select your desired Output Format.</p>
<p>Lastly, hit the Render 1 File button, and then REAPER will export your project. You can immediately listen to it by selecting the ‘Launch File’ option.</p>
