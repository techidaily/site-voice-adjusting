<p>The journalists, influencers, celebrities, and a friend of yours, everyone has a podcast! Even though the podcast is there for a decade, it is becoming highly famous now. It all started in 2005 when Apple announced broadcasting podcasts. There were radios before podcasting, and still, they are there!</p>

<p>We are now talking about <strong>video podcasts</strong> in the best possible manner. Is it worth creating video when it is primarily for audio format? Yes, it is not that easy as it seems to be! There are many versions to create video podcasts. Turning on a video while making a podcast is quite smart as now you have the required video content to post on YouTube. But that would be painful if you can’t hold the audience’s attention for more than five minutes. Visually compelling contents seem to be very important, especially when hosting your podcast on a central social platform such as YouTube.</p>
<p>Stay tuned as we are going to unleash the required elements to make the best video podcasts!</p>

Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can’t listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well.

<h2 id="Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference-3"><a href="#Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?"></a>Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Content</strong></p>
<p>The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong></p>
<p>The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Versions</strong></p>
<p>You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo&#x2F; Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.</p>
<h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting-3"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting"></a>Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting</h2><p>There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale.

On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.</p>
<p>A video podcast is the better alternative if you don’t have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong></p>
<p>Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube.

<p>Cons of Video Podcasts</p>
