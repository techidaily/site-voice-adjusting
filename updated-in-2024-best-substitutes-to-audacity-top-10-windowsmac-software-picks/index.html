<p>For a <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blogs.articulate.com/rapid-elearning/4-simple-tips-for-recording-high-quality-audio/" >recording to have good audio quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, it needs to have as little background noise as possible. Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Noise reduction</strong> is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.</p>
<p>The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do <strong>noise reduction in Audacity</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-do-noise-reduction-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity"></a>Part 1: How to do noise reduction in Audacity</h2><p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/" >Audacity <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a lightweight opensource audio recording and editing software that’s used by many serious podcasters and vloggers. It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE. You can know more infomation of Audacity from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pcmag.com/review/362572/audacity" >PCmag review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. This recording will provide a clear sample of the background noise in the room and will be very useful in the noise reduction process. See steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first step is to create a NOISE PROFILE. This profile tells Audacity the nature of the noise to be reduced or eliminated from the audio recording. To create a NOISE PROFILE, open your ROOM TONE recording and click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li>
<li>If you didn’t make a ROOM TONE recording, then open the audio file you want to process. Once opened, click and drag over a section that contains mostly noise to select it. Then, click on EFFECT &gt; NOISE REDUCTION.</li>
</ul>

Background noise is any constant sound which was not intentionally added to an audio recording. The lesser the background noise a listener can hear, the better the quality of an audio recording. This is why noise reduction is a very important part of the finishing process for audio recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Noise reduction</strong> is the process of getting rid of any constant background noises or interfering sounds that muddy the clarity of your audio recording or distract from its substance. With noise reduction, you can get rid of constant background sounds like the hum of a machine, the buzz of a fan, whistles, whines, and hisses.</p>
<p>The good news is that with software like Audacity, amateurs and professionals can easily do noise reduction in a few simple steps. In this post, we show you how to easily do <strong>noise reduction in Audacity</strong>.</p>

It has PC and MAC versions, and it can be downloaded with an easy-to-read manual. Before you begin the noise reduction process, assess your audio recording, taking note of parts that have background noise and the different background sounds in the recording. You should also form the habit of taking a separate recording of the ROOM TONE.

<p>Apple’s video editing program, iMovie, is a popular choice. By removing background noise and raising audio levels of quiet clips, iMovie may likewise modify and enhance the audio of a project.</p>
<p>iMovie gives you the basic, no-frills editing tools you need to make a movie out of a collection of video clips. Without using videotape, you can easily browse from scene to scene and save your edits and changes in digital format. The end product is a high-quality digital video movie that you can save as a QuickTime file or dump back to digital videotape.</p>

How to Separate&#x2F;Detach&#x2F;Split Audio from Video in iMovie on Mac</h2><p>The iMovie program is capable of producing high-quality movies and videos. If you’re dealing with a video that includes both sound and pictures, you may want to split the two at some point.</p>
<p>To separate audio from video in iMovie on Mac, just open the video and follow the steps below.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Remove-the-audio-clip-from-the-video"><a href="#Step-1-Remove-the-audio-clip-from-the-video" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Remove the audio clip from the video"></a>Step 1. Remove the audio clip from the video</h4><p>In your iMovie timeline, find the clip that contains both video and audio.</p>
<p>Right-click the clip or hold <strong>Control</strong> and click it. You can also go to the menu bar and choose <strong>Detach Audio</strong>.</p>
<p>The audio from that clip will then show as its own “clip” in green below the video. The little line on the left, however, confirms that the video and audio are still connected. This implies that if you delete the video, you’ll lose the audio as well. As a result, you’ll either need to move the audio clip somewhere else in your video or place it in the Background Music Well at the bottom of the timeline.</p>
<p>Simply select, drag, and drop the green audio clip where you want it. It will be in the background of all other noises in your movie if you set it in the Background Music Well.</p>

The video can then be downloaded to your computer by selecting <strong>Download Video</strong> from the dropdown menu after hitting the <strong>Publish</strong> button.</p>
