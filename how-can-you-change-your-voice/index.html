<p>Various ways could be used to get this done. The article understudy will talk about different practices to change your voice, and we will also discuss voice changers with effects to change your voice. If you want to learn about changing your voice, then let’s get started!</p>

What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?"></a>Part 1. What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?</h2><p>Naturally, a person’s voice changes with time. Although time is not only the reason, the environment also plays an essential role in changing voice. The environment has a significant effect on the way someone walks, talks, or even how someone acts on something. There are various factors upon which your voice sounds unique and special; some of these factors are briefly discussed below:</p>

                ></p>
<h3 id="1-Gender"><a href="#1-Gender" class="headerlink" title="1. Gender"></a>1. Gender</h3><p>Females have small vocal cords as compared to males since birth. Then at puberty, the rise in the testosterone level causes the larynx to enlarge, and that changes your voice. Over time, the vocal cords thicken and tighten, which creates a vibration in sound along with deeper resonance. For females, the cords do not get tight, which results in a high pitch in the female voice.</p>
<h3 id="2-Structure-of-Anomalies"><a href="#2-Structure-of-Anomalies" class="headerlink" title="2. Structure of Anomalies"></a>2. Structure of Anomalies</h3><p>The structure of anomalies is referred to as cleft palates deviated spectrum. Anomalies affect the clearness that is in a person’s voice. The structure of one’s voice can be altered by the age, overall health, cleanliness, and emotional state of a person. Alongside the texture of sound, pitch and timbre can also change your voice.</p>
<h3 id="3-Body-Structure"><a href="#3-Body-Structure" class="headerlink" title="3. Body Structure"></a>3. Body Structure</h3><p>Bodyweight plays a vital role in changing voice. Obese men produce excessive estrogen that causes a rise in their voices. On the contrary, obese women have excessive testosterone that makes their voice deeper than others. Being obese makes the breath control better that results in generating a raspy sound.</p>
<h3 id="4-Height"><a href="#4-Height" class="headerlink" title="4. Height"></a>4. Height</h3><p>Underweight people have less endurance which increases the chance of injury to vocal cords. In comparison, heightened people have comparatively bigger lungs and larger lower airways, causing them to produce deeper voices compared to short people.</p>
<h3 id="5-Heredity"><a href="#5-Heredity" class="headerlink" title="5. Heredity"></a>5. Heredity</h3><p>Heredity and genetics play an important role in shaping your voice as it is a part of your anatomy too. Genetics is why you might find people from the same family have similar voices. Sound is made by the vocal cords that are in the larynx. The larynx is given a genetic code, which alters itself over time. These alterations, as a reaction, change your voice.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-in-Practice"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-in-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?"></a>Part 2. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?</h2><p>There are multiple reasons why someone wants to change their voice. Someone might not be satisfied with their low pitch voice or want to have a deeper voice. At the same time, you might also want to change your voice to any frictional character. Or you might want to change your voice to Morgan freeman too.</p>
<p>The real question is ‘Can you change your voice?’. Yes, it is possible. There are a lot of ways to do it, but they differ in complexity and effectiveness. You can either use any voice changer, or else you can also choose the natural way, which is a long-term approach. A few ways to change your voice in practice are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="Change-the-Way-you-Talk"><a href="#Change-the-Way-you-Talk" class="headerlink" title="Change the Way you Talk"></a>Change the Way you Talk</h3><p>Expressions change the emotions that affect the voice. Nasal and non-nasal voices differ as the nasal voices have a higher pitch as compared to non-nasal sounds. Changing the accent also affects the voice. The voice apparently stays the same, but the hearings of words change to make others feel the change of voice—for example, American and British accents.</p>
<h3 id="Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords"><a href="#Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords" class="headerlink" title="Taking Care of Vocal Cords"></a>Taking Care of Vocal Cords</h3><p>Taking care of vocal cords can help change your voice. Smoking causes loss of voice and lowers the range of voice. Screaming can damage the vocal cords that automatically affects the voice. Breathing in polluted air not only changes the voice but also damages the vocal cords.</p>
<h3 id="Vocal-Exercises"><a href="#Vocal-Exercises" class="headerlink" title="Vocal Exercises"></a>Vocal Exercises</h3><p>There are some exercises that relax the vocal cords. These exercises include massaging the throat to loosen tense muscles, humming, taking deep breaths. Another exercise is loosening the jaw by opening it wide and closing it gently. Lip buzzing, yawning, and tongue trills are also considered exercises for vocal cords that can change your voice.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-with-Voice-Changer-Apps"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-with-Voice-Changer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Change Your Voice with Voice Changer Apps?"></a>Part 3. How to Change Your Voice with Voice Changer Apps?</h2><p>As we mentioned earlier that there are various ways to change your voice.

Someone might not be satisfied with their low pitch voice or want to have a deeper voice. At the same time, you might also want to change your voice to any frictional character. Or you might want to change your voice to Morgan freeman too.</p>
<p>The real question is ‘Can you change your voice?’. Yes, it is possible. There are a lot of ways to do it, but they differ in complexity and effectiveness. You can either use any voice changer, or else you can also choose the natural way, which is a long-term approach. A few ways to change your voice in practice are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="Change-the-Way-you-Talk-3"><a href="#Change-the-Way-you-Talk-3" class="headerlink" title="Change the Way you Talk"></a>Change the Way you Talk</h3><p>Expressions change the emotions that affect the voice. Nasal and non-nasal voices differ as the nasal voices have a higher pitch as compared to non-nasal sounds. Changing the accent also affects the voice. The voice apparently stays the same, but the hearings of words change to make others feel the change of voice—for example, American and British accents.</p>
<h3 id="Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords-3"><a href="#Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords-3" class="headerlink" title="Taking Care of Vocal Cords"></a>Taking Care of Vocal Cords</h3><p>Taking care of vocal cords can help change your voice. Smoking causes loss of voice and lowers the range of voice. Screaming can damage the vocal cords that automatically affects the voice. Breathing in polluted air not only changes the voice but also damages the vocal cords.</p>
<h3 id="Vocal-Exercises-3"><a href="#Vocal-Exercises-3" class="headerlink" title="Vocal Exercises"></a>Vocal Exercises</h3><p>There are some exercises that relax the vocal cords. These exercises include massaging the throat to loosen tense muscles, humming, taking deep breaths. Another exercise is loosening the jaw by opening it wide and closing it gently.

<h2 id="How-to-Choose-the-Best-Dictation-Software-3"><a href="#How-to-Choose-the-Best-Dictation-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose the Best Dictation Software"></a>How to Choose the Best Dictation Software</h2><p>All the dictation software mentioned above performs very well for transcribing into text, and some of them have additional features which might be very helpful. The best software for you will depend on the purpose for which you are using it.</p>
