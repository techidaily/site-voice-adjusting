<h2 id="Recording-Voice-On-Windows"><a href="#Recording-Voice-On-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Recording Voice On Windows"></a><strong>Recording Voice On Windows</strong></h2><p>If you are using a pc or desktop, then keep in mind that most operating systems have their own default recording software that comes pre-installed. Most people don’t know about them, and they rush for 3rd party applications for sound recording purposes. It doesn’t matter if you use Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11. Windows operating system also has its recorder app. It will be available on your system, and all you need to do is find it and use it. If you are unsure how to do that, then follow the steps given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the search options of your windows and type “Voice Recorder” in it.</li>
<li>Click on the search button, and the voice recorder app will appear in the top searches.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Recording-Voice-On-Mac"><a href="#Recording-Voice-On-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Recording Voice On Mac"></a><strong>Recording Voice On Mac</strong></h2><p>If you are using Mac operating system, then it also has its recording app. Just follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>Recordings can be created using the built-in microphone, an external microphone, or a headset with a supported microphone. If you’re signed in with the same Apple ID on your iPad, iPhone, or Mac, you can listen to your Voice Memos recordings on any of those devices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Record button (or use the Touch Bar) inside the Voice Memos app on your Mac.</li>
<li>By clicking the Pause button, you can pause the video. You can resume the video by clicking Resume.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the page, click Done when you are finished.</li>

<h2 id="Record-Voice-Using-Audacity"><a href="#Record-Voice-Using-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Record Voice Using Audacity"></a><strong>Record Voice Using Audacity</strong></h2><p>Although you can record the computer audio using built-in tools, many 3rd party tools like Audacity provide you with more features and better quality than the built-in tools. To use Audacity for recording your pc audio, follow the steps given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems. So, you can try searching “audacity windows 7”, “audacity windows 8”, “audacity windows 10”, or “audacity mac” depending upon the operating system you are using.</li>
<li>Once it is installed, run the software, and its interface will appear on your screen.</li>
<li>Now you’ll need to customize the drop-down boxes above the timeline. The farthest thing on the left should be ‘Windows WASAPI’. From the next choice to the right, choose ‘Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio) (loopback)’.</li>
<li>It’s important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers</li>
<li>Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time</li>
<li>Audio editing tools like Audacity allow you to edit your recording after recording it and export it in several formats based on what you recorded.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>That’s how it works. Here are two easy ways to record the audio coming from your PC. Record internal audio (such as what comes out of your microphone) with Windows&#x2F;Mac 10’s built-in ‘Voice Recorder’ app or Audacity. These applications are both extremely simple to use. To get the best audio quality, we recommend trying our Filmora Audio tools. Although Audacity does the job pretty well with filmora audio tools and voice packs, you can add many voice effects and edit your audio professionally. Give it a try as it is free to use.</p>

<li>First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems.

<li>It’s important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers</li>
<li>Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time</li>

<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021"><a href="#Best-Free-Song-Finder-Apps-for-Android-in-2021" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021"></a>Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021</h2><p>Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.</p>
<h3 id="1-Google-App"><a href="#1-Google-App" class="headerlink" title="1. Google App"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US" >Google App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.</p>
<p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.</p>
<p>This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:</p>
<p>Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.</p>
<p>Step 2- Either click on the “Search a song” button or say “what’s this song?” before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That’s it. That’s all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.</p>
<p>It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, “Hey Google, what’s this song?” before humming the tune, and that’s about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.</p>
<p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p>

<p>There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.</p>
<p>You tried searching for that song in your phone’s music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song’s name or any definitive lyrics or the artist’s name.</p>
<p>Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.</p>

<p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results.

<p>This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:</p>
<p>Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.</p>

<p>It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, “Hey Google, what’s this song?” before humming the tune, and that’s about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.</p>
<p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p>

Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use.

Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.</p>
<p>Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results.

<p>And don’t worry about the quality of your humming. It need not be pitch perfect, just distinct and clear enough.</p>
