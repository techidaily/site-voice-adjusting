<p>AudioTag is an easy-to-use song identifier online service. You upload an audio fragment, the duration of which can be as short as 10 seconds or as long as the entire song, and then let the website’s audio recognition engine do its job. After it analyses your uploaded audio file, every available information regarding that audio file, like the title of the song, artist’s name, album title, etc., are extracted and put at your disposal.</p>
<p>The audio file you upload can be in any format, ADPCM, .WAV, .FLV, .MP3,.MP4, or other commonly used audio file formats. It can be a digitized recording from an old tape recording or a downloaded file from the internet. AudioTag can identify audio in video files too.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The service is free</li>
<li>Can work with a wide range of audio file formats</li>
<li>It has got a robust database that contains songs from the 1940s to present times</li>
<li>The algorithm can differentiate between separate songs in a single recording</li>
<li>Can identify songs in low- quality recording</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is a possibility of inaccuracy in recognizing the song</li>
<li>The algorithm cannot match uploaded files with songs that are melodically similar</li>
