<p>The process of making a video has always been painstakingly long, and even though digital cameras and video editing apps that emerged in the last couple of decades have made this process somewhat easier, creating captions for videos you share online is still a time-consuming endeavor. Accessibility and better retrievability by search engines are among the most common reasons why video content producers choose to add captions to the videos they share on social media and video hosting platforms. If you are looking for a way to save some time on creating subtitles for your videos you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best speech to text platforms that enable you to generate captions in just a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Converting-Audio-to-Text-2"><a href="#Converting-Audio-to-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="Converting Audio to Text"></a>Converting Audio to Text</h2><p>Before we proceed any further we would like to note that the platforms and apps we featured in this article can only help you generate a subtitle file and that you are going to have to use a video editing software or an online subtitling platform to add that file to a video. Here are some of the best options for converting audio to text in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text-2"><a href="#1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text-2" class="headerlink" title="1. IBM Watson Speech to Text"></a>1. IBM Watson Speech to Text</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, different subscription plans available</p>
<p>Watson was initially created to answer questions on a popular quiz show called Jeopardy, and over time IBM developed a cloud-based version of the software that turns audio into text. The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.</p>
<p>Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sonix-2"><a href="#2-Sonix-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Sonix"></a>2. Sonix</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, subscription plans start from $17.25 per month</p>

You can either upload audio or a video file and Sonix will generate a transcript of it in a remarkably short period of time, so you can transcribe a 30-minute audio file in less than five minutes. Transcriptions Sonix generates are not always a hundred percent accurate, but you can edit each word that this speech to text platform has generated in its Audio-Text editor.</p>
<p>Moreover, the platform is equipped with a video player so you can see your videos next to the transcript, which can be quite useful if you are trying to correct the misspellings and other mistakes. The best part is that Sonix has Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition integration, so you can add markers, metadata, captions or make rough cuts on both audio and video files you use in your projects.</p>

Simply upload the file to Amber Script and the platform will generate the text for you. The text may not be entirely accurate, but you can easily make all corrections from the Amber Script’s text editor that offers speaker distinction and timestamp features. In case you don’t want to edit the text by yourself, you can choose a subscription plan that guarantees a 100% accuracy, as well as other advanced options. You can export the text in a variety of file formats, including commonly used text file formats such as SRT, json or docx, and use it for a wide array of purposes just minutes after you’ve transformed an audio file into text.</p>

Keep in mind that you are going to have to specify the start and end points of the transcription which allows you to create text from only a portion of the video or audio file. Once the conversion is completed, you will have to wait for your request to be processed before you can download the text the platform generated for you.</p>

<p>Over the past decade or so, computer users have recorded their audio and converted it into a digital format with relative ease. However, users look to record computer audio at even the highest quality levels.

This article will guide you to record your computer audio using a PC easily. We will share different methods using which you can record computer audio.</p>
<p>This article is not directed at potential audio recorders but rather at those looking to improve the audio quality of their recordings. Users will already have their microphone and recording equipment, yet they may find this article useful.</p>
<h2 id="Recording-Voice-On-Windows"><a href="#Recording-Voice-On-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Recording Voice On Windows"></a><strong>Recording Voice On Windows</strong></h2><p>If you are using a pc or desktop, then keep in mind that most operating systems have their own default recording software that comes pre-installed. Most people don’t know about them, and they rush for 3rd party applications for sound recording purposes. It doesn’t matter if you use Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11. Windows operating system also has its recorder app. It will be available on your system, and all you need to do is find it and use it. If you are unsure how to do that, then follow the steps given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the search options of your windows and type “Voice Recorder” in it.</li>
<li>Click on the search button, and the voice recorder app will appear in the top searches.</li>
</ol>

                ></p>
<ol>
<li>Just open the app, and a recording button will appear on the screen. All you need to do is, click on the recording icon, and it will start recording your audio from your microphone, and when you are done recording, you click on the stop recording button, and it will automatically be saved on your computer.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Recording-Voice-On-Mac"><a href="#Recording-Voice-On-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Recording Voice On Mac"></a><strong>Recording Voice On Mac</strong></h2><p>If you are using Mac operating system, then it also has its recording app. Just follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>Recordings can be created using the built-in microphone, an external microphone, or a headset with a supported microphone. If you’re signed in with the same Apple ID on your iPad, iPhone, or Mac, you can listen to your Voice Memos recordings on any of those devices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Record button (or use the Touch Bar) inside the Voice Memos app on your Mac.</li>
<li>By clicking the Pause button, you can pause the video. You can resume the video by clicking Resume.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the page, click Done when you are finished.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Record-Voice-Using-Audacity"><a href="#Record-Voice-Using-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Record Voice Using Audacity"></a><strong>Record Voice Using Audacity</strong></h2><p>Although you can record the computer audio using built-in tools, many 3rd party tools like Audacity provide you with more features and better quality than the built-in tools. To use Audacity for recording your pc audio, follow the steps given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems. So, you can try searching “audacity windows 7”, “audacity windows 8”, “audacity windows 10”, or “audacity mac” depending upon the operating system you are using.</li>
<li>Once it is installed, run the software, and its interface will appear on your screen.</li>
<li>Now you’ll need to customize the drop-down boxes above the timeline. The farthest thing on the left should be ‘Windows WASAPI’. From the next choice to the right, choose ‘Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio) (loopback)’.</li>
<li>It’s important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers</li>
<li>Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time</li>
<li>Audio editing tools like Audacity allow you to edit your recording after recording it and export it in several formats based on what you recorded.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>That’s how it works. Here are two easy ways to record the audio coming from your PC. Record internal audio (such as what comes out of your microphone) with Windows&#x2F;Mac 10’s built-in ‘Voice Recorder’ app or Audacity. These applications are both extremely simple to use. To get the best audio quality, we recommend trying our Filmora Audio tools. Although Audacity does the job pretty well with filmora audio tools and voice packs, you can add many voice effects and edit your audio professionally. Give it a try as it is free to use.</p>

<h2 id="Recording-Voice-On-Windows-1"><a href="#Recording-Voice-On-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="Recording Voice On Windows"></a><strong>Recording Voice On Windows</strong></h2><p>If you are using a pc or desktop, then keep in mind that most operating systems have their own default recording software that comes pre-installed. Most people don’t know about them, and they rush for 3rd party applications for sound recording purposes. It doesn’t matter if you use Windows 7, 8, 10, or 11. Windows operating system also has its recorder app. It will be available on your system, and all you need to do is find it and use it. If you are unsure how to do that, then follow the steps given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the search options of your windows and type “Voice Recorder” in it.</li>
<li>Click on the search button, and the voice recorder app will appear in the top searches.</li>

<li>Just open the app, and a recording button will appear on the screen. All you need to do is, click on the recording icon, and it will start recording your audio from your microphone, and when you are done recording, you click on the stop recording button, and it will automatically be saved on your computer.</li>

<h2 id="Recording-Voice-On-Mac-1"><a href="#Recording-Voice-On-Mac-1" class="headerlink" title="Recording Voice On Mac"></a><strong>Recording Voice On Mac</strong></h2><p>If you are using Mac operating system, then it also has its recording app. Just follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>Recordings can be created using the built-in microphone, an external microphone, or a headset with a supported microphone. If you’re signed in with the same Apple ID on your iPad, iPhone, or Mac, you can listen to your Voice Memos recordings on any of those devices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Record button (or use the Touch Bar) inside the Voice Memos app on your Mac.</li>
<li>By clicking the Pause button, you can pause the video. You can resume the video by clicking Resume.</li>
<li>At the bottom of the page, click Done when you are finished.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Record-Voice-Using-Audacity-1"><a href="#Record-Voice-Using-Audacity-1" class="headerlink" title="Record Voice Using Audacity"></a><strong>Record Voice Using Audacity</strong></h2><p>Although you can record the computer audio using built-in tools, many 3rd party tools like Audacity provide you with more features and better quality than the built-in tools. To use Audacity for recording your pc audio, follow the steps given below.</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems. So, you can try searching “audacity windows 7”, “audacity windows 8”, “audacity windows 10”, or “audacity mac” depending upon the operating system you are using.</li>
<li>Once it is installed, run the software, and its interface will appear on your screen.</li>
<li>Now you’ll need to customize the drop-down boxes above the timeline. The farthest thing on the left should be ‘Windows WASAPI’. From the next choice to the right, choose ‘Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio) (loopback)’.</li>
<li>It’s important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers</li>
<li>Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time</li>
<li>Audio editing tools like Audacity allow you to edit your recording after recording it and export it in several formats based on what you recorded.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Final-Verdict-1"><a href="#Final-Verdict-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>That’s how it works. Here are two easy ways to record the audio coming from your PC. Record internal audio (such as what comes out of your microphone) with Windows&#x2F;Mac 10’s built-in ‘Voice Recorder’ app or Audacity. These applications are both extremely simple to use. To get the best audio quality, we recommend trying our Filmora Audio tools. Although Audacity does the job pretty well with filmora audio tools and voice packs, you can add many voice effects and edit your audio professionally. Give it a try as it is free to use.</p>

<p>Over the past decade or so, computer users have recorded their audio and converted it into a digital format with relative ease. However, users look to record computer audio at even the highest quality levels. And while the technology needed to achieve this is readily available in both software and hardware forms, it can be somewhat complex.</p>
