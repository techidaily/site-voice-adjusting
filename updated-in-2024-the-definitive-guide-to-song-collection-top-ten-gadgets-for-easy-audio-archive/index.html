One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.</p>
<p>You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.</p>
<p>Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:</p>
<p>Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About, and then you will see the software version.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Open Settings&gt; Control Center, and then tap <strong>More</strong> to scroll down.</p>
<p>Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center</p>
