<h2 id="Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What are podcast directories?"></a>Part 1. What are podcast directories?</h2><p>A podcast directory is a listening app. It’s the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories.

<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube"><a href="#1-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

<p>Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create video-based podcasts seamlessly.

<p>Tools like Fimora also allow you to directly publish the created Podcast on YouTube (so you do not have to worry about video requirements mandatory for YouTube).</p>

<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 2.5 billion active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: All major OS and web browsers.</li>

<h3 id="2-Spotify"><a href="#2-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="2. Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory spotify"
                ></p>
<p>Spotify’s personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily&#x2F; Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Spotify on G2</strong>: “I can find any song, artist, album, and even podcasts at any time and no commercials.”</li>

<h3 id="3-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#3-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple Podcasts"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.apple.com/" >Apple Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Apple Podcast</strong>: “Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service.”</li>

A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Google Podcast</strong></li>

<p>“Google Podcast includes everything that a podcast listener wants. It’s simple, free, and includes valuable options like Sleep Timer, Playback speed, and more.”</p>

It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

</ul>
<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>

Already, my pod site feels “complete” to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand.”</p>

<p>Part 1. What are podcast directories?</p>
<p>A podcast directory is a listening app. It’s the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024-1"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories. So this list will help us locate the best podcasting directories. And it can multiply your audience size and quickly reach a more extensive user base.</p>
<p>According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:</p>

                      alt="edison podcast metrics"
                ></p>
<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube-1"><a href="#1-YouTube-1" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory youtube"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform.

<h3 id="2-Spotify-1"><a href="#2-Spotify-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>

<p>Spotify’s personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily&#x2F; Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.</p>

Apple Podcasts"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.apple.com/" >Apple Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Apple Podcast</strong>: “Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service.”</li>

A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Google Podcast</strong></li>

It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

</ul>
<p>**”**Been using this for years. It does everything I could ever want when listening&#x2F; referencing&#x2F; re-listening to my favorite podcasts and a lot more.</p>
<p>I’ve suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something “exclusive”), but I couldn’t stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.</p>
<p>Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you’re coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app.”</p>

<p>“Glad I waited a while to find a podcast website provider. Starting from scratch in WordPress seemed too much hassle. Luckily the site came along while I was dithering about what to do.</p>
<p>The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I’m delighted to have chosen this option. Already, my pod site feels “complete” to look at, and more features are coming soon that will help with marketing, understanding listeners, and building a podcast brand.”</p>
