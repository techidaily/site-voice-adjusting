<h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>It has been a little over fifteen years since Ben Hammersley coined the term podcast. During this time, radio and TV stations, as well as people from all walks of life, have embraced this new medium of spreading information through either audio or video files.</p>
<p>Even though podcasts often have the form of a talk show, the topics podcasters cover in their shows range from presenting the latest music releases to discussing political topics. Listening to a podcast from a Smartphone without a player is not an option, which is why we made a selection of some of the best podcast player apps for iPhone and Android devices.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Podcast-Player-Apps-for-iOS-and-Android-Devices"><a href="#Best-Free-Podcast-Player-Apps-for-iOS-and-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Podcast Player Apps for iOS and Android Devices"></a>Best Free Podcast Player Apps for iOS and Android Devices</h2><p>Nearly all <strong>podcast player apps</strong> have similar features. You can discover new shows, limit how many episodes can be downloaded to your device or reduce silences to the very minimum.</p>
<p>The list of features a podcast player provides should help you determine if that app is the right choice for you. Here are some of the best free podcast player apps for iOS and Android devices you can find on the market in 2019.</p>

<p>The platform’s editor recommends the shows based on your browsing history and helps you discover content that you are going to enjoy watching and listening to. Even so, Apple Podcasts lack the tools that enable its users to control the playback speed, skip intros or set timers before they go to sleep.</p>

<p>The process of making a video has always been painstakingly long, and even though digital cameras and video editing apps that emerged in the last couple of decades have made this process somewhat easier, creating captions for videos you share online is still a time-consuming endeavor. Accessibility and better retrievability by search engines are among the most common reasons why video content producers choose to add captions to the videos they share on social media and video hosting platforms. If you are looking for a way to save some time on creating subtitles for your videos you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best speech to text platforms that enable you to generate captions in just a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Converting-Audio-to-Text"><a href="#Converting-Audio-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="Converting Audio to Text"></a>Converting Audio to Text</h2><p>Before we proceed any further we would like to note that the platforms and apps we featured in this article can only help you generate a subtitle file and that you are going to have to use a video editing software or an online subtitling platform to add that file to a video. Here are some of the best options for converting audio to text in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text"><a href="#1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1.

<p>Watson was initially created to answer questions on a popular quiz show called Jeopardy, and over time IBM developed a cloud-based version of the software that turns audio into text. The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.</p>
<p>Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sonix"><a href="#2-Sonix" class="headerlink" title="2. Sonix"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sonix.ai/" >Sonix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, subscription plans start from $17.25 per month</p>
<p>This feature-rich platform is designed to help storytellers tell their stories. You can either upload audio or a video file and Sonix will generate a transcript of it in a remarkably short period of time, so you can transcribe a 30-minute audio file in less than five minutes. Transcriptions Sonix generates are not always a hundred percent accurate, but you can edit each word that this speech to text platform has generated in its Audio-Text editor.</p>
<p>Moreover, the platform is equipped with a video player so you can see your videos next to the transcript, which can be quite useful if you are trying to correct the misspellings and other mistakes. The best part is that Sonix has Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition integration, so you can add markers, metadata, captions or make rough cuts on both audio and video files you use in your projects.</p>
<h4 id="3-Amber-Script"><a href="#3-Amber-Script" class="headerlink" title="3.

<p>Regardless of the pricing plan you choose, Amber Script lets you create text from audio files in 29 different languages. In addition, some pricing plans allow you to create text from both audio and video files, so you can easily make subtitles for your videos. Simply upload the file to Amber Script and the platform will generate the text for you. The text may not be entirely accurate, but you can easily make all corrections from the Amber Script’s text editor that offers speaker distinction and timestamp features. In case you don’t want to edit the text by yourself, you can choose a subscription plan that guarantees a 100% accuracy, as well as other advanced options. You can export the text in a variety of file formats, including commonly used text file formats such as SRT, json or docx, and use it for a wide array of purposes just minutes after you’ve transformed an audio file into text.</p>

<p>This free online converter lets you turn YouTube or any other type of video or audio file to text for free. You can upload a file directly from your computer, use a video’s URL if it is stored online or import it from personal cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Currently, you can only transcribe video and audio files that are in English, French, Hindi and Chinese languages which can limit your options if the text you’d like to generate is in another language. Keep in mind that you are going to have to specify the start and end points of the transcription which allows you to create text from only a portion of the video or audio file. Once the conversion is completed, you will have to wait for your request to be processed before you can download the text the platform generated for you.</p>
<h4 id="5-Sobolsoft-MP3-Speech-to-Text-Converter-Software"><a href="#5-Sobolsoft-MP3-Speech-to-Text-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="5.

<p>Installing Lame for Audacity is a simple process with no extra tools required. Right-click and choose “Install,” then restart your computer. Continue to press the “Next” button until you’ve completed the task. A lame mp3 encoder may now be installed. However, here are the procedures to follow in order to utilize and begin the mp3 encoding process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Audacity and choose “Edit” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Select “Preferences” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Look for the “File Formats” tab, &amp; then click on the “Find Library” button to locate the appropriate library.</li>
<li>Look for the file “lame enc.dll,” which may be found in “C: program file same for audacity,” select it, and then click the “Open” button to go further.</li>
<li>The “Preferences” menu in Audacity has a number of optional options. There is an option to modify the bit rate. Once you have finished adjusting the bit rate, you may return to the main Audacity page by clicking on the “OK” button.</li>
<li>Select “File” and then “Export to mp3” from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Save the file on your computer. You will be required to input the ID3 tags for the artist’s name and the title of the music into the Audacity program. By clicking “Ok,” the encoding procedure for the file into the mp3 format will begin.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may either download or develop a suitable version of the Lame mp3 encoder, after which you can install it. Following installation, look for lame for audacity in the library choices. The majority of Linux distributions have a form of package manager that detects, downloads, and installs software packages from the internet for you. Once you’ve opened the package manager, look for Lame and then install it if it hasn’t already been done so.</p>

<p>Some distributions, such as the Ubuntu(Current) distribution, provide packages for Audacity, which includes mp3 encoding, and Libav, which is connected to the appropriate system libraries. It is not necessary to identify LAME or FFmpeg in the Audacity builds that have previously been packaged since there are no library choices for Audacity.</p>
<p>If you construct Audacity from source code, you may disable libraries’ preferences by setting Audacity as follows: Disable &gt; Dynamic &gt; Encoding &gt; Disable &gt; Dynamic &gt; Encoding &gt; Disable &gt; Dynamic &gt; Encoding. Finally, create an instance of Audacity that is connected to the LAME system. Additionally, you may build FFmpeg or Libav on your own computer if you so wish.</p>

The actions outlined below are beneficial if the Lame option is available in Library preferences, &amp; you also have a suitable version of Lame installed in a place other than the default one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch audacity and choose Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Libraries from the drop-down menu on the left side of the screen.</li>
<li>A Lame version number appears to the right of mp3 when it is exported from the mp3 Export Library. If LAME has been identified, you should export an mp3 and disregard the rest of the instructions. If, on the other hand, the mp3 Library displays “Not Found,” go to the procedures below.</li>
<li>To the right of the mp3 Library, click on the locating tab to open a search bar.</li>
<li>When the “Locate Linux” dialogue box displays, pick Browse from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>A dialogue window with the text “Where is Limp3lame?” appears.</li>
<li>I can’t find Limp3lame. Please help. so. To exit Preferences, press 0 and hit Open, then OK and OK again.</li>
</ul>
