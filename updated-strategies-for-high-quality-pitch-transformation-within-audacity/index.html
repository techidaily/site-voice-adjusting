Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the <strong>Audacity change pitch</strong> feature. Let’s get started.</p>

Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p>
<p>On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?"></a>Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries. Several applications offer sound editing tools to serve the needs of the people. Pitch-changing is one of the common tools that people look for in sound editors.</p>
<p>Audacity is one of the notable software that allows users to change the pitch of the voice. It comes with an <strong>Audacity pitch shift</strong> mechanism to facilitate users. So, if you are editing sound in Audacity, changing the pitch is just a matter of a few clicks. Are you still wondering how you can apply the <strong>Audacity change pitch</strong> technique when editing? Here’s how you can do it in simple steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Select the audio portion</strong></p>
<p>Launch Audacity and add sound recordings you want to edit. Click on the timeline and drag to select the portion of the sound.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only the portion whose pitch you want to change.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Open Effect menu</strong></p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Effect</strong> tab at the top right of the screen next to <strong>Generate.</strong> Select <strong>Pitch Change</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also make other changes, such as <strong>Change Speed</strong> and <strong>Change Tempo</strong> option will let you alter the speed of the sound. So, the pitch can also be altered using this process.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Adjust pitch</strong></p>
<p>Drag the slider to alter the pitch of the sound and press the OK button to apply changes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To increase pitch, slide towards the right. Similarly, slide towards the left to a lower pitch. In addition, the pitch can also be changed by configuring <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong> parameters.</p>

Sometimes, the sound is too loud or low. Audacity can help you in such a situation. So, if you are editing sound recordings in Audacity, you can also fix the volume of the sound. The good thing to note is that you can adjust the sound in both directions, which implies you can easily amplify or reduce the volume in these open-source applications. Are you interested in knowing about the volume adjustment process in Audacity? If yes, we have summarized the process in simple steps. Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Add an audio file</strong></p>
<p>Launch the software and click on <strong>File</strong>. Select <strong>Open</strong> and select the desired audio.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended to change the volume through the playback volume knob at the top right corner of the screen, as this will only increase the volume in your device. However, the actual volume of the audio will remain unchanged.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Increase&#x2F;Decrease audio gain</p>
<p>Change the gain of the audio at the left-hand side of the screen. Move the slider to adjust the volume to the desired level.</p>

Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p>

<p>The editing process starts with importing the audio track. The audio material in the sequence must be at the primary place. Always place the audio track in the first position even if you are importing multiple audio tracks. You can leave the track underneath for editing purposes. After adding this first audio file, you can add sound effects, music, and other secondary audio files for further editing.</p>
<p><strong>Listen again</strong></p>
<p>Don’t proceed before re-listening your added audio! This manner will let you think for different sections, and you can further decide what to keep and what to preserve. Remove any computer noise, background hiss, and unwanted audio areas. Here, you can help with different noise reduction tools available or go for the reliable podcast editing software, specifically the audio ducking feature for noise removal.</p>
<p><strong>Make it consistent throughout</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to make the volume consistent at every stage of the podcast. After removing all the unwanted noises, take the necessary action to normalize the audio levels and specifically select -2.0 for peak amplitude. Amplify the tranquil areas.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Designing and Mixing</strong></p>
<p>Then, you are required to do sound designing and mixing for the podcast. Take it lightly and only especially when you are a beginner. Add the sound effects as per the message of the podcast. Always keep in mind to use significant sound effects that effectively evoke the emotion and ultimately save the audience engaged. The mixing part comes when you compress, equalize, and process the audio to adjust accordingly in the different sections.</p>
<p><strong>Preview and Post</strong></p>
<p>Once your podcast is edited and ready, preview it ensure everything is in place, especially if it is your first time. It would be best to post a clear, concise, and to the point audio&#x2F;video.

<p><img

<p><strong>Reaper</strong></p>

Learn some advanced formulas of podcast audio editing as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Trim the Ends</strong></p>
<p>It’s better if you trim the ends before editing the podcast. And, make sure there are no blanks at the beginning or end of the podcast. You can also add fade-in or fade-out effects to avoid unprofessional vibes.</p>
<p><strong>Work on your planning and presentation skills</strong></p>
<p>Focus on having a time-saving podcast editing by working upon your planning and presentation skills. Don’t be that guy who tries to edit every verbal crutch. Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.</p>
<p><strong>Provide margin and look for transitions</strong></p>
<p>Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn’t provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.</p>
<p>Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate awkward silences</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust the volume of the podcast</strong></p>
<p>It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.</p>
<p><strong>Save podcast to the right format</strong></p>
<p>Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.</p>

<p><strong>Alitu</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

Learn some advanced formulas of podcast audio editing as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Trim the Ends</strong></p>
<p>It’s better if you trim the ends before editing the podcast. And, make sure there are no blanks at the beginning or end of the podcast. You can also add fade-in or fade-out effects to avoid unprofessional vibes.</p>
<p><strong>Work on your planning and presentation skills</strong></p>
<p>Focus on having a time-saving podcast editing by working upon your planning and presentation skills. Don’t be that guy who tries to edit every verbal crutch. Instead, focus on being confident while presenting the podcast so that you will need to have significantly fewer editing issues or may not need editing at all. Think upon changing the approach of podcast recording as well.</p>
<p><strong>Provide margin and look for transitions</strong></p>
<p>Offer a little margin and say that thing smoothly again if you have misread or misspell the statement while recording the podcast. Thus, you must not squeeze the information that doesn’t provide a better room for podcast editing. The provided margin will make it a breeze to cut out the messy audio portion.</p>
<p>Then, you have to look for transitions precisely when you are recording in multiple tracks, co-hosting, or taking a long space while recording your podcast. These transitions could be like pointless babbles, awkward silences, cross talks, etc., that need careful watch at both the beginning and the end. Most of the editing will improve by considering and editing these kinds of transitions.</p>
<p><strong>Eliminate awkward silences</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes a podcast is full of awkward silences that look crap at all. Well, you don’t have to remove every silence taken at the end of a talk or something like that. Eliminate only long, awkward silences or reduce their duration. Different plugins are available within the DAWs to remove these background noises and long duration silences.</p>
<p><strong>Adjust the volume of the podcast</strong></p>
<p>It may be a bit tricky to edit the podcast when one person or interviewee is a lot quieter. First of all, check if their microphone signals and settings are strong enough to provide you with audio. Then, you can increase the gain of their speaker before podcast editing. Normalize the voice or add some compression to increase the loudness ultimately.</p>
<p><strong>Save podcast to the right format</strong></p>
<p>Finally, you must be careful while exporting your podcast to the correct format to ensure the best quality. Go to the export settings and find MP3 extension and 192kbps bitrate.</p>
<h2 id="Edit-Podcast-with-Video-Editor-2"><a href="#Edit-Podcast-with-Video-Editor-2" class="headerlink" title="Edit Podcast with Video Editor"></a>Edit Podcast with Video Editor</h2><p>Are you recording a video podcast?

There are various podcast editing services, and styles worth consider. The list below is the critical podcast editing basics a beginner should follow before publishing the podcast. Overall, it would be awesome if you learn new skills instead of outsourcing the whole stuff. That’s fantastic as well!</p>
<p><strong>Firstly, import the audio.</strong></p>
<p>The editing process starts with importing the audio track. The audio material in the sequence must be at the primary place. Always place the audio track in the first position even if you are importing multiple audio tracks. You can leave the track underneath for editing purposes. After adding this first audio file, you can add sound effects, music, and other secondary audio files for further editing.</p>
<p><strong>Listen again</strong></p>
<p>Don’t proceed before re-listening your added audio! This manner will let you think for different sections, and you can further decide what to keep and what to preserve. Remove any computer noise, background hiss, and unwanted audio areas. Here, you can help with different noise reduction tools available or go for the reliable podcast editing software, specifically the audio ducking feature for noise removal.</p>
<p><strong>Make it consistent throughout</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to make the volume consistent at every stage of the podcast. After removing all the unwanted noises, take the necessary action to normalize the audio levels and specifically select -2.0 for peak amplitude. Amplify the tranquil areas.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Designing and Mixing</strong></p>
<p>Then, you are required to do sound designing and mixing for the podcast. Take it lightly and only especially when you are a beginner. Add the sound effects as per the message of the podcast. Always keep in mind to use significant sound effects that effectively evoke the emotion and ultimately save the audience engaged. The mixing part comes when you compress, equalize, and process the audio to adjust accordingly in the different sections.</p>
<p><strong>Preview and Post</strong></p>
<p>Once your podcast is edited and ready, preview it ensure everything is in place, especially if it is your first time. It would be best to post a clear, concise, and to the point audio&#x2F;video. Finally, post your podcast, either for free or using one of the software available online on your desired blog&#x2F;online media.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Pick-the-Right-Podcast-Player-App-3"><a href="#How-to-Pick-the-Right-Podcast-Player-App-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?"></a>How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?</h2><p>The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.</p>
