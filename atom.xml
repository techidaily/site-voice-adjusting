To convert the text into voice in Windows, it is necessary to use an external service provider. We know that Siri voice generator is the best text-to-voice converter to use while converting your text to audio. But unfortunately, Apple hasn’t introduced any website for their Siri Voice Generator. This makes it difficult for the users of the Windows operating system to convert their text into a voice using Siri. But there is no need to be worried, we are here to help you solve this problem. We have found some of the best text-to-voice converter websites that will provide you with the same experience of Siri and its features. There are multiple websites out there that claim to generate the best Siri voices. But it is difficult to choose the best one from all those platforms. We are going to provide you with the best alternative of Siri that can provide you with the same features and qualities as Siri. One of the best alternatives for Siri is Google text to Speech.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech"><strong>Google Text-to-Speech</strong></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-speech-to-text-poster.png"                      alt="google-speech-to-text-poster"                ></p><p><strong>Price:</strong> Chart Attached</p><p><strong>Language Coverage:</strong> 40+</p><p><strong>Voice Choices:</strong> 220+</p><p>There is no doubt in the fact that there is no platform or website that can take place of Siri. But Google’s Text-to-Speech service is something worth considering as an alternative to Siri. With its service, Google provides its users with a wide variety of language choices to choose from to fulfill the need of every user, no matter where the user lives. The best thing about Google Text-to-Speech is its extensive range of voice choices. You have more than 220 voices to choose from for your content. There is no need to make all your content sound similar. You can always change the voice of your content to match it with the content type and its audience. Google uses the latest technologies to provide you the customized voices for your brand to stand out from the crowd and make your videos and other content unique and different from others. Google incorporates DeepMind’s speech synthesis to provide you with the best and most accurate results. The voice generated by Google can’t be differentiated because it sounds like a natural and human-like voice. But the thing that makes it less attractive is its pricing. Unlike Siri for Mac, Google charges its user for using its Text-to-voice service on the basis of characters. But all the astounding features and natural voices of Google text-to-speech makes it worth every penny you spend on it. Google has two packages to be availed, Standard and WaveNet. The WaveNet package contains the voices that are used by Google in its products and service such as Google Search, Google Assistance, and Google Translate.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>PACKAGE</strong></th><th><strong>PRICE</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Standard Voices</strong></td><td>$4.00&#x2F;1 Million Characters</td></tr><tr><td><strong>WaveNet Voices</strong></td><td>$16.00&#x2F;1 Million Characters</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Just like Google Text-to-Speech, there various other amazing platforms that provide you with the same services like Siri. You can find the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 5 Online Test to Speech Website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that we will suggest to you as the best alternatives to Siri.

That’s when we follow the process of audio ducking in <strong>Premiere Pro</strong> that would automatically lower the volume of the background music whenever there is a dialogue.</p><p>The best thing about Premiere Pro audio ducking is that it is an automatic process and we don’t need to put a lot of effort. To make your job easier, I’m going to let you know how to use the Adobe Premiere Pro audio ducking feature in a step by step manner in this guide.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Use-Audio-Ducking-to-Balance-Music-and-Voiceover-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Use-Audio-Ducking-to-Balance-Music-and-Voiceover-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Use Audio Ducking to Balance Music and Voiceover in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?"></a>Part 1: How to Use Audio Ducking to Balance Music and Voiceover in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?</h2><p>If you have been using Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac, then you would already be familiar with the wide range of editing features that it has. One of them is the Premiere Pro audio ducking option that comes inbuilt in the application. Using it, you can automatically lower the volume of the background music and amplify your dialogues.</p><p>To perform auto-ducking in Premiere Pro, we first need to define each audio track and then use the ducking feature. Here’s how you can also perform audio ducking in Premiere Pro like a pro.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Define-the-Audio-Types"><a href="#Step-1-Define-the-Audio-Types" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Define the Audio Types"></a>Step 1: Define the Audio Types</h4><p>Since Adobe Premiere Pro can’t automatically detect the type of sounds, you need to do it manually. To do audio ducking in Premiere Pro, you can first import your video clip and the voiceover to the application, and drag them to the working timeline.</p><p>Now, you can first select the voiceover file that you want to amplify, and from the sidebar on the right, click on “Dialogue” as the type of the audio file.</p><p>Once you mark the audio type, you will get different options. Here, go to the “Loudness” option and click on the “Auto Match” button.</p><p>Afterward, you can do the same for your background audio file. Select the file and choose its audio type as “Music”. You can also set its loudness to “Auto Match” if you want to.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Perform-Auto-Ducking-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Step-2-Perform-Auto-Ducking-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Perform Auto Ducking in Premiere Pro"></a>Step 2: Perform Auto Ducking in Premiere Pro</h4><p>Now when you have set the audio types, you can just find the Ducking option on the sidebar and turn it on. Here, you can first click on the dialogue icon from the top and get the needed options. You can adjust its sensitivity and set a level or improve or reduce its quality.</p><p>Apart from the dialogue icon, you can also click on the Music icon and do the same. For instance, you can reduce the quality of the background music and increase the level of the dialogue track.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Make-the-Final-Changes"><a href="#Step-3-Make-the-Final-Changes" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Make the Final Changes"></a>Step 3: Make the Final Changes</h4><p>Great! You can now preview the changes you have made and check the audio ducking results in Premiere Pro. If you want to finalize things, then you can perform keyframing and manually adjust the volume.</p><p>Furthermore, you can also perform an instant hard ducking in Premiere Pro. For this, just choose the track, go to the side panel, and select <strong>Preset</strong> &gt; <strong>Music</strong> &gt; <strong>Hard Vocal Ducking</strong>. While it would get instant results in Adobe Premiere audio ducking, the results might not be so effective.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Part-2-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Part 2: Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>As you can see, the Premiere Pro audio ducking feature can get a bit complicated if you are a beginner. Therefore, if you are looking for a simpler and more effective automatic ducking solution, then use Wondershare Filmora. This intuitive and diverse video&#x2F;audio editing tool has an automatic audio ducking option that would make your job a whole lot easier.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>To learn how to perform automatic audio ducking in your videos on Mac via Wondershare Filmora, one can follow these steps:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Load-the-Video-or-Audio-Files-on-Filmora"><a href="#Step-1-Load-the-Video-or-Audio-Files-on-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Load the Video or Audio Files on Filmora"></a>Step 1: Load the Video or Audio Files on Filmora</h4><p>Firstly, you can just launch Wondershare Filmora on your Mac and import your videos&#x2F;audios.

Now you can see your video and the audio track on the timeline of Filmora. At first, you need to select the voiceover (or any other track) that you want to amplify.</p><p>Once the desired audio track is selected, right-click it, and choose the “Adjust Audio” option.</p><p>As the dedicated Audio Editor will open, just go to the “Ducking” option at the bottom and turn on the “Lower the volume of other clips” feature. You can further select the level to lower the volume of other background clips in the video here.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Save-and-Export-Your-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Save-and-Export-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Save and Export Your Video"></a>Step 3: Save and Export Your Video</h4><p>That’s it! After making the changes, just click on the “OK” button and Filmora would automatically adjust the volume of other clips. You can further make the needed changes in the video and click on the “Export” icon. This will let you save the project in the desired format and resolution on your computer.</p><p>Who knew it would be so easy to do auto-ducking in Premiere Pro, right?

As much as most of us have perfectly pleasant voices, regardless of how they sound when we hear them played back, sometimes we just don’t have a good quality voice for video making.</p><p>Some people try to get around this by relying on the written word. While that’s OK in some situations, it’s just not as engaging as a high-quality voiceover. So, what can you do?</p><p>Many video makers have found great success in altering their voice ever so slightly. If they have a tendency to garble, slowing things down can help them get their point across better. Similarly, if they have a somewhat squeaky voice, adjusting the tone down a couple of notches can make them appear more authoritative.</p><p>Good video editing tools will allow you to play with the speed and pitch of your audio recordings, and not just voices either. Perhaps you want to jazz up a piece of music by playing it faster or add a playful element to your video by cranking the pitch of the music up to chipmunk levels.</p><p>Whatever you have in mind, being able to edit the speed and tone of audio in our videos opens up a world of possibilities for voiceover, music and more.</p><h2 id="Adjusting-speed-and-pitch-in-Adobe-Rush"><a href="#Adjusting-speed-and-pitch-in-Adobe-Rush" class="headerlink" title="Adjusting speed and pitch in Adobe Rush"></a>Adjusting speed and pitch in Adobe Rush</h2><p>We were excited to see what Adobe had in store for us as soon as they started talking about Rush. Branded a tool for the social media generation, it promised incredible usability, effortless integration with a variety of platforms and all the wonderful editing powers that Adobe are renowned for.</p><p>However, there have been more than a few oversights in what Adobe actually produced.</p><p>Users have complained that its slow, that rendering takes too long and that the software can be unstable. Worse than that, it seems that a number of key features are missing, such as being able to adjust the speed of video and to change the pitch and speed of audio too.</p><p>In short, if you’re looking for a way to edit audio to be slower or faster, higher or lower in Adobe Rush, you simply can’t. However, there is an alternative.</p><p>From the team at Wondershare comes a package known as <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; an all in one video editing suite designed to do everything you need, and more. Within the capabilities of this software is the ability to edit your audio’s pitch and speed, so that you can create the perfect auditory accompaniment to your movies and videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><h2 id="How-to-edit-audio-in-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-edit-audio-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to edit audio in Filmora"></a>How to edit audio in Filmora</h2><p>Using the tools built into Filmora, you can change the pitch and speed of audio in just a few clicks. The function works on all imported audio, whether its attached to the video, recorded separately or is music that you’ve added to your library.</p><p>We’ll talk you thorough how to use these editing tools, so that you know you’ve got an alternative to Adobe Rush.</p><p>The easiest way to edit the pitch of the audio in Filmora is to use the edit button on the control panel. Highlight the clip you want to edit, then use the button which features three lines with sliders.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audio-panel-in-filmora9.png"                                     ></p><p>Clicking this button will open up the edit menu, which allows you to edit video, audio, color and motion. Within the audio edit, you can fade the soundtrack in and out, can alter the pitch and can adjust the volume and equalizer settings too.</p><p>Within this menu, a handy tool will allow you to ‘remove background noise’ also. You can also set audio to fade in or out and can adjust the equalizer to suit the type of audio you’re working with.</p><p>To change the speed of the audio along with the pictures, you can use the speedometer button above your track. You can also right click the clip and choose ‘Speed and duration’, or even use the shortcut ctrl+R to open the speed change menu directly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choose-audio-speed-filmora9.png"                                     ></p><p>If you wish to change the speed of the audio without changing the video at all, you’ll need to detach the audio from the video clip. This is simple; just right click the clip in question and select ‘Detach Audio’. You can now edit the audio independently of the video.</p><p>Of course, if you’re working on audio which is standalone, e.g. a voiceover or some music you want to play with your video, there’s no requirement to detach it from any video clip.</p><p>On the right-hand side of the screen, you’ll also discover the Audio Mixer, in the button with the musical notes on it. Clicking on this brings up an advanced audio adjuster, which can help you create a better audio quality for your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-mixer-filmora9.png"                                     ></p><p>This allows you to adjust the specific settings of the videos you’ve uploaded, as well as any additional audio tracks you’ve added to your project. You can work in stereo or surround sound and can control the direction of all the audio within the mixer.</p><p>Wondershare Filmora has managed to not only provide a service Adobe has not, they’ve made it super easy too. Why don’t you try out the free version of Filmora for yourself and see why we recommend this for all your video editing needs.</p><p><img                       lazyload

Before you start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro, you should know their difference.</p><ul><li><em>Clip Keyframes</em>: This would apply audio effects for the selected clip (like adjusting the volume level). The audio keyframe will only apply to the clip that you have selected and not the entire track.</li><li><em>Track Keyframes</em>: These audio keyframes in Premiere are applied to the entire audio track (they have values like Volume and Mute).</li></ul><p>Now when we have covered the basics, let’s learn how to set up audio keyframes in Premiere on your Mac.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Add the Audio Track on Adobe Premiere Pro</strong></p><p>To start with, you can launch Adobe Premiere Pro, go to your Project &gt; Import, and simply load any audio track. You can also drag and drop any audio file to the project as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Import Audio Files in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p>Once the audio track is added to the project, you can further drag and drop it to the sequence section (timelines) at the bottom.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-to-timeline-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Add Audio to Timeline in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Show Keyframes for the Track</strong></p><p>The application would automatically render different keyframes already present in the track. For this, you need to first select the ribbon of your audio track from the timeline. Now, just right-click on the working area and click on the “Show Audio Keyframes” button from the context menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-audio-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Show Audio Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p>If you want, you can also click on the “Show Keyframes” button that is depicted by a radio&#x2F;circle icon on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-keyframes-button-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Show Keyframes Button in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Work on Audio Keyframes in Premiere Pro</strong></p><p>Now, you can view either clip or track keyframes for the track. For this, you can just right-click the keyframe button on the timeline to get different options. Here, you can choose to get Clip or Track keyframes in Premiere Pro. There are options to mute the entire audio or set up its volume under the track option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/track-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Track Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p>Once you have enabled the audio keyframe options in Premiere Pro, you can view keyframes in a highlighted color. You can now take the assistance of the Pen tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select keyframes. This will let you select the starting and ending keyframes in Premiere Pro so that you can easily apply the desired effect to the selected segment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.gif"                      alt="Select Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Fade-Audio-In-Out-with-Keyframes-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Fade-Audio-In-Out-with-Keyframes-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Fade Audio In&#x2F;Out with Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?"></a>Part 2: How to Fade Audio In&#x2F;Out with Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro on Mac?</h2><p>Once you have learned how to use the Adobe Premiere keyframe feature, you can apply all kinds of transitions and effects to a segment. Let’s suppose you wish to implement fade-in or out features for any segment. In this case, we will use the Clip Keyframing option in Premiere Pro to achieve these transitions the way we like.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Get Clip Keyframes in Premiere Pro</strong></p><p>Firstly, you can just add any audio track to your Premiere Pro project and drag it to the timeline. You can just click on the show keyframes button to start adding keyframes in Premiere Pro.</p><p>If you want, you can just right-click the track, go to the <strong>Show Clip Keyframes</strong> &gt; <strong>Volume</strong> &gt; <strong>Level</strong> option. This will show the level of the volume for different keyframes, letting you pick the right segments to fade in and out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-clip-keyframes-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Show Clip Keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Apply Fade-in or Out options</strong></p><p>Once you have clip keyframes in your track, you can easily do whatever you like. You can use the <strong>Pen</strong> tool or press the CMD key on your Mac to select the starting and the ending of the clip.</p><p>Now, go to the audio segment from the timeline and simply place the audio level up (to fade-in) or down (to fade-out). You can set the audio levels for different segments the way you like to customize these operations in your audio track.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fade-in-out-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Fade In and Out in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p><strong>Pro Tip: Use Inbuilt Fade In&#x2F;Out Transitions</strong></p><p>With keyframes in Premiere Pro, you can certainly customize the fade in&#x2F;out options. Though, if you are running short on time, then you can use its inbuilt features for audio adjustments.</p><p>For this, you can just go to its <strong>Effects</strong> &gt; <strong>Audio Transitions</strong> option. To fade-out any clip, select the <strong>Crossfade</strong> &gt; <strong>Exponential Fade</strong> and simply drag and drop to the location of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crossfade-effects-adobe-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Crossfade Effects in Adobe Premiere Pro"                ></p><p>In the same way, you can also go to <strong>Effects</strong> &gt; <strong>Audio Transitions</strong> &gt; <strong>Crossfade</strong> and choose the “Constant Gain” feature. You can drag and drop the Contact Gain effect on any segment to implement the fade-in effect.</p><p>That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to set up audio keyframes in Adobe Premiere Pro. Since adding keyframes in Premiere can be done automatically, it would save your time in audio editing and post-production. Mostly, the clip audio keyframing is used in Adobe to customize the sound at any desired segment. Apart from fade-in or out, there are tons of other effects that you can apply to your audio tracks with the help of keyframes. Go ahead and try the Adobe Premiere Pro keyframing feature and let us know about your experience in the comments.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/5-proven-methods-to-record-quality-sound-on-apple-devices-for-2024/"><u>5 Proven Methods to Record Quality Sound on Apple Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/mastering-audio-extraction-removing-sound-tracks-from-video-on-ios-devices/"><u>Mastering Audio Extraction Removing Sound Tracks From Video on iOS Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-skypessay-revolutionize-communication-by-altering-your-voice-on-video-calls/"><u>Updated SkypEssay Revolutionize Communication by Altering Your Voice on Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-10-best-free-and-paid-podcast-editing-software-products/"><u>New 10 Best Free and Paid Podcast Editing Software Products</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/revealed-the-5-superior-mac-compatible-audio-mixers-for-2024/"><u>Revealed The 5 Superior Mac-Compatible Audio Mixers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-identifying-the-highest-rated-8-vocal-transcription-systems-available-on-pcs-and-macs/"><u>Updated Identifying the Highest Rated 8 Vocal Transcription Systems Available on PCs & MACs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-audience-captivation-technique-how-to-personalize-your-speech-with-audacitys-vocal-effects-for-2024/"><u>Updated Audience Captivation Technique How to Personalize Your Speech with Audacitys Vocal Effects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-voice-memo-solution-comparing-vocaroo-and-its-competitors/"><u>In 2024, The Ultimate Voice Memo Solution Comparing Vocaroo and Its Competitors</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-your-meizu-21-location-on-life360-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Your Meizu 21 Location on life360 Without Anyone Knowing? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-elevate-video-quality-with-vlcs-high-resolution-webcam-recording/"><u>[Updated] Elevate Video Quality with VLC's High-Resolution Webcam Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-the-nuances-of-nonlinear-audio-editing-in-audacity/"><u>In 2024, Navigating the Nuances of Nonlinear Audio Editing in Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-edge-of-insanity-the-10-most-chaotic-tiktok-contests/"><u>[Updated] Edge of Insanity  The 10 Most Chaotic TikTok Contests</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-from-zero-to-hero-steps-to-construct-your-channels-backlinks/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, From Zero to Hero  Steps to Construct Your Channel's Backlinks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-clips.techidaily.com/updated-hide-and-discover-instagram-stories-leaders-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Hide & Discover  Instagram Stories Leaders for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-driven-video-production.techidaily.com/updated-resize-and-refine-image-aspect-ratio-for-2024/"><u>Updated Resize and Refine Image Aspect Ratio for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-securely-grab-free-picture-frame-videos/"><u>In 2024, How to Securely Grab Free Picture Frame Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-navigate-video-trimming-with-ease-on-windows-11-photos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Navigate Video Trimming with Ease on Windows 11 Photos</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the <strong>Audacity change pitch</strong> feature. Let’s get started.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is pitch, and how does it work?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-pitch-and-how-does-it-work"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-pitch-and-how-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?"></a>Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?</h2><p>Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.</p><p>On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Pitch-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?"></a>Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries. Several applications offer sound editing tools to serve the needs of the people. Pitch-changing is one of the common tools that people look for in sound editors.</p><p>Audacity is one of the notable software that allows users to change the pitch of the voice. It comes with an <strong>Audacity pitch shift</strong> mechanism to facilitate users. So, if you are editing sound in Audacity, changing the pitch is just a matter of a few clicks. Are you still wondering how you can apply the <strong>Audacity change pitch</strong> technique when editing? Here’s how you can do it in simple steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Select the audio portion</strong></p><p>Launch Audacity and add sound recordings you want to edit. Click on the timeline and drag to select the portion of the sound.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Only the portion whose pitch you want to change.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-audio-portion-to-change-pitch-audacity.jpg"                      alt="select audio portion to change pitch audacity"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Open Effect menu</strong></p><p>Click on the <strong>Effect</strong> tab at the top right of the screen next to <strong>Generate.</strong> Select <strong>Pitch Change</strong> from the drop-down menu.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can also make other changes, such as <strong>Change Speed</strong> and <strong>Change Tempo</strong> option will let you alter the speed of the sound. So, the pitch can also be altered using this process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-effect-change-pitch.jpg"                      alt="audacity effect change pitch"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Adjust pitch</strong></p><p>Drag the slider to alter the pitch of the sound and press the OK button to apply changes.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To increase pitch, slide towards the right. Similarly, slide towards the left to a lower pitch. In addition, the pitch can also be changed by configuring <strong>From</strong> and <strong>To</strong> parameters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-change-pitch-without-changing-tempo.jpg"                      alt="audacity change pitch without changing tempo"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Section-How-to-Adjust-Sound-Louder-in-Audacity"><a href="#Bonus-Section-How-to-Adjust-Sound-Louder-in-Audacity" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Section: How to Adjust Sound Louder in Audacity?"></a>Bonus Section: How to Adjust Sound Louder in Audacity?</h2><p>Volume in an audio file may or may not be ideal for use. Sometimes, the sound is too loud or low. Audacity can help you in such a situation. So, if you are editing sound recordings in Audacity, you can also fix the volume of the sound. The good thing to note is that you can adjust the sound in both directions, which implies you can easily amplify or reduce the volume in these open-source applications. Are you interested in knowing about the volume adjustment process in Audacity? If yes, we have summarized the process in simple steps. Let’s take a look.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Add an audio file</strong></p><p>Launch the software and click on <strong>File</strong>. Select <strong>Open</strong> and select the desired audio.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not recommended to change the volume through the playback volume knob at the top right corner of the screen, as this will only increase the volume in your device. However, the actual volume of the audio will remain unchanged.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audacity-audio-file.jpg"                      alt="open audacity audio file"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Increase&#x2F;Decrease audio gain</p><p>Change the gain of the audio at the left-hand side of the screen. Move the slider to adjust the volume to the desired level.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-audio-gain-audacity-sound-louder.jpg"                      alt="adjust audio gain audacity sound louder"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Alternatively, you may also increase or increase the volume through the amplification process. To use this method, select the audio portion, access <strong>Effect,</strong> and tap <strong>Amplify</strong>. Tick <strong>allow clipping</strong> box and move the slider to set the volume of the sound.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>There are high chances of audio sound not being in the required pitch or volume. Plus, you may also need to change the sound characteristics of an audio file for specific use. So, if this is the case, the Audacity change pitch technique is all you need to learn. Thus, we have summarized the process of changing pitch and volume in a step-by-step guide in this article. Hopefully, all your concerns will have been addressed.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</a></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhancing-vocal-quality-post-pitch-correction-using-audacity/"><u>In 2024, Enhancing Vocal Quality Post-Pitch Correction Using Audacity</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-premium-list-of-mp3-to-text-conversion-applications/"><u>Updated In 2024, Premium List of MP3-to-Text Conversion Applications</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-accelerating-conversion-of-whatsapp-audios-to-mp3-format/"><u>New In 2024, Accelerating Conversion of WhatsApp Audios to MP3 Format</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/the-kaleidoscope-of-game-audio-spotting-the-buttons-sonic-impressions/"><u>The Kaleidoscope of Game Audio Spotting the Buttons Sonic Impressions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/when-can-i-implement-side-chain-compression-for-enhanced-clarity-for-2024/"><u>When Can I Implement Side-Chain Compression for Enhanced Clarity for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/finding-optimal-applications-for-effective-sound-isolation-in-videos-and-audios-for-2024/"><u>Finding Optimal Applications for Effective Sound Isolation in Videos and Audios for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-elite-lineup-of-audio-reverse-applications-discovering-your-ideal-choices-for-mobile-and-computing/"><u>Updated In 2024, The Elite Lineup of Audio Reverse Applications Discovering Your Ideal Choices for Mobile & Computing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://voice-adjusting.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-how-to-remove-audio-from-video-on-windows-10-free-and-no-download-ways/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved How to Remove Audio From Video on Windows 10?

Clearing the Media File Cache</h3><p>If you tried to import a video file into a project and the app notified you that it cannot import the file because there is no audio stream, you should head over to the <strong>Edit menu</strong> and select the <strong>Preferences Tab.</strong> Once the Preferences window pops up on the screen, click on the <strong>Media tab</strong> and then proceed to delete all files that are stored in the <strong>Media Cache Database</strong> and <strong>Media Cache Files</strong> folders. Restart the application after you’ve cleaned both of these folders and try to import the video clips into the project once more. If the issue persists, there are a few more things you can do.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/Clearing-Media-File-Cache-no-sound.jpg"                      alt="clear Media File Cache"                ></p><h3 id="2-Renaming-the-Media-Cache-Folder"><a href="#2-Renaming-the-Media-Cache-Folder" class="headerlink" title="2.

So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to <strong>Media Cache Files_OLD</strong> and <strong>Media Cache_OLD</strong>. Start Adobe Premiere Pro and check if you can import your video files into the editor.</p><h3 id="3-Moving-Media-Files-to-a-Different-Folder"><a href="#3-Moving-Media-Files-to-a-Different-Folder" class="headerlink" title="3.

To create a new project, tap on the “New Project” button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-1.jpg"                      alt="make a new project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Import from File Tab</strong></p><p>Once a new window opens, three different methods can be used to import audio on Filmora. Tap on “File” to select the option of “Import Media Files” from “Import Media” in the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-2.jpg"                      alt="use file tab to import audio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Import from Import Button</strong></p><p>The second method calls up users to import audio through a button. The user needs to tap on the “Import Media Files Here” button to add audio in Filmora directly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on import button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Import by Drag and Drop</strong></p><p>Users can import audios on Filmora in another way. They can drag and drop the audio files directly on the platform and perform functions using different tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-4.jpg"                      alt="drag and drop audio file"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If the methods of fixing the audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro we presented in this article don’t help you solve this problem, you should consider reinstalling the OS on your computer.
