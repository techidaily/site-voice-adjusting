Accessibility and better retrievability by search engines are among the most common reasons why video content producers choose to add captions to the videos they share on social media and video hosting platforms. If you are looking for a way to save some time on creating subtitles for your videos you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best speech to text platforms that enable you to generate captions in just a few minutes.</p><h2 id="Converting-Audio-to-Text"><a href="#Converting-Audio-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="Converting Audio to Text"></a>Converting Audio to Text</h2><p>Before we proceed any further we would like to note that the platforms and apps we featured in this article can only help you generate a subtitle file and that you are going to have to use a video editing software or an online subtitling platform to add that file to a video. Here are some of the best options for converting audio to text in 2024.</p><h4 id="1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text"><a href="#1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1. IBM Watson Speech to Text"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://speech-to-text-demo.ng.bluemix.net/" >IBM Watson Speech to Text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, different subscription plans available</p><p>Watson was initially created to answer questions on a popular quiz show called Jeopardy, and over time IBM developed a cloud-based version of the software that turns audio into text. The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.</p><p>Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p><h4 id="2-Sonix"><a href="#2-Sonix" class="headerlink" title="2. Sonix"></a>2. <a class="link"   href="https://sonix.ai/" >Sonix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, subscription plans start from $17.25 per month</p><p>This feature-rich platform is designed to help storytellers tell their stories. You can either upload audio or a video file and Sonix will generate a transcript of it in a remarkably short period of time, so you can transcribe a 30-minute audio file in less than five minutes. Transcriptions Sonix generates are not always a hundred percent accurate, but you can edit each word that this speech to text platform has generated in its Audio-Text editor.</p><p>Moreover, the platform is equipped with a video player so you can see your videos next to the transcript, which can be quite useful if you are trying to correct the misspellings and other mistakes. The best part is that Sonix has Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition integration, so you can add markers, metadata, captions or make rough cuts on both audio and video files you use in your projects.</p><h4 id="3-Amber-Script"><a href="#3-Amber-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Amber Script"></a>3. <a class="link"   href="https://www.amberscript.com/en" >Amber Script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $6 per hour of uploaded audio</p><p>Regardless of the pricing plan you choose, Amber Script lets you create text from audio files in 29 different languages. In addition, some pricing plans allow you to create text from both audio and video files, so you can easily make subtitles for your videos. Simply upload the file to Amber Script and the platform will generate the text for you. The text may not be entirely accurate, but you can easily make all corrections from the Amber Script’s text editor that offers speaker distinction and timestamp features. In case you don’t want to edit the text by yourself, you can choose a subscription plan that guarantees a 100% accuracy, as well as other advanced options. You can export the text in a variety of file formats, including commonly used text file formats such as SRT, json or docx, and use it for a wide array of purposes just minutes after you’ve transformed an audio file into text.</p><h4 id="4-360Converter"><a href="#4-360Converter" class="headerlink" title="4. 360Converter"></a>4. <a class="link"   href="https://www.360converter.com/conversion/video2TextConversion" >360Converter <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p>This free online converter lets you turn YouTube or any other type of video or audio file to text for free. You can upload a file directly from your computer, use a video’s URL if it is stored online or import it from personal cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Currently, you can only transcribe video and audio files that are in English, French, Hindi and Chinese languages which can limit your options if the text you’d like to generate is in another language. Keep in mind that you are going to have to specify the start and end points of the transcription which allows you to create text from only a portion of the video or audio file. Once the conversion is completed, you will have to wait for your request to be processed before you can download the text the platform generated for you.</p><h4 id="5-Sobolsoft-MP3-Speech-to-Text-Converter-Software"><a href="#5-Sobolsoft-MP3-Speech-to-Text-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="5.

The software is easy to use, as you just have to select the audio files you’d like to transcribe and hit the Start Converting button. All the text the software generates will be displayed in the Results window where you can edit it, copy it to clipboard or save it as a text file. However, this software doesn’t provide support for video files, which means that you can’t use it to transcribe files that are saved in MP4, AVI, MOV or any other of the popular video file formats. You can try the Sobolsoft’s MP3 Speech to Text Converter for free and decide if you want to purchase the license to use the software without any restrictions.</p><h4 id="6-InqScribe"><a href="#6-InqScribe" class="headerlink" title="6. InqScribe"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://www.inqscribe.com/" >InqScribe <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $99 for an individual license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows, macOS</p><p>Even though you can’t generate text automatically with InqScribe, this app for PC and Mac computers is still one of the best ways to create subtitles for your videos or transcripts of audio files. The software offers support for a large number of languages so you can use several different languages in the same document.

The popularity of beat edits has gone through the roof in the era of social media videos, as so many YouTubers and video content creators produce videos that are perfectly synced to the music. This video editing technique can be used in a single scene or throughout an entire video, depending on the project and the effect you would like the video to make on the viewer. Read on if you would like to learn how to edit video clips to match the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><h2 id="How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free"><a href="#How-to-Edit-and-Auto-Sync-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Adobe-Premiere-Pro-for-Free" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?"></a>How to Edit and Auto-Sync Video Clips to the Beat of a Song in Adobe Premiere Pro for Free?</h2><p> Before you start editing clips to the beat, you must first ensure that all of the materials you want to include in that video are imported into the project you created in Adobe Premiere Pro. Once the footage you intend to use in your video is in the Media Bin, you should head over to the <strong>New</strong> submenu in the <strong>File menu</strong>.</p><p> Afterward, you can add an audio file to the timeline and ensure that the sequence settings are correct. The audio file is going to serve as the core around which you are going to build the entire video, which is why it is important to select a rhythmic song that has clearly distinguishable beats.</p><p> Click on the <strong>Wrench icon</strong> and choose the <strong>Show Audio Waveform</strong> option from the drop-down menu, so that you can see the beats in the audio file. Make sure that the sequence you created is selected and not the audio file you added to the timeline and then position the playhead at the beginning of the song. Listening to the music to which you would like to edit your video a few times is recommended because it will enable you to better understand where the beats are located.</p><p> When ready start adding markers to the sequence by using the <strong>M keyboard shortcut</strong>, so that every beat of the song contains a marker. This may take a few tries because hitting the beats can be difficult for video editors that don’t have any musical talents, but with practice, you should be able to position the markers precisely where they need to be. Also, you can make the adjustments to the video you’re creating after you sync your footage with the audio so even if the markers aren’t positioned perfectly you can make corrections later.</p><p> Head over to the Media Bin and proceed to add <strong>In and Out points</strong>, by either clicking on their icons or using the <strong>I and O buttons</strong>, to all video clips you want to edit to the beat. By doing so you will let Adobe Premiere know which parts of the video clips you want to keep and where it should create cuts. After setting the In and Out points for all the video clips you would like to use in your project you just have to select them. The order in which your footage is selected is important as it will determine where they are going to be placed on the timeline.</p><p> Choose the <strong>Automate to Sequence</strong> option from the <strong>Clip menu</strong> and once the Automate to Sequence window appears on the screen you should choose the <strong>Selection Order</strong> option from the <strong>Ordering menu</strong>. Afterward, you should select the <strong>At Unnumbered Markers</strong> setting from the <strong>Placement menu</strong> and change the <strong>Method to the Overwrite Edit.</strong></p><p> Make sure that the <strong>Use In&#x2F;Out Range</strong> option is enabled and click on the <strong>Ignore Audio</strong> checkbox if your video clips also contain audio. Click OK to confirm the changes and Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically match your footage to the markers you added to the sequence.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Edit-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-with-BeatEdit-Extension-for-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#How-to-Edit-Video-Clips-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-with-BeatEdit-Extension-for-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?"></a>How to Edit Video Clips to the Beat of a Song with BeatEdit Extension for Adobe Premiere Pro?</h2><p> Placing markers at each beat in the song can be both difficult and time-consuming, which defeats the purpose of using Adobe Premiere Pro to automate this process.

Here’s how you can edit video clips to match the beat with BeatEdit.</p><p><strong>How to Edit Footage to the Beat in Premiere Pro with the BeatEdit Extension?</strong></p><p> In order to download and install the BeatEdit in Adobe Premiere Pro, you must pay a one-time $99,99 fee. After you go through the installation process, you can launch BeatEdit from the <strong>Extensions submenu</strong> that is located in the Window menu.</p><p> After the BeatEdit window pops up on the screen you should click on the <strong>Load Music</strong> button in order to start the beat detection process. After the audio file is analyzed blue lines are going to be displayed at each beat and you’ll be able to hear a click sound if you play the song. BeatEdit lets you adjust the volume of the audio file you analyzed and enables you to select the beats where you want to make the cuts in your footage.</p><p> You can choose if you want to select beats evenly or randomly, specify their frequency or select the portion of the song from which you want to select the beats. The extension also lets you add extra markers that are not located at beat and adjust their amount or minimum distance. BeatEdit generates clip and sequence markers, so make sure that the sequence markers option is selected before clicking on the <strong>Create Markers</strong> button.</p><p> Add the audio file you would like to use in your video to the Adobe Premiere Pro’s timeline and proceed to select the video clips in the Media Bin. Place the playhead at the beginning of the timeline and select the Automate to Sequence option from the Clip menu. You can then select the same settings you’d select if you added the markers to the sequence on your own.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Editing videos to the beat of a song in Premiere Pro is becoming increasingly popular among video content creators.

Imagine a world without sounds or music, and on the other hand, you live in a world that has music everywhere! Which one would you actually prefer to live in?</p><p>Likewise, foreground or background music for videos plays a vital role. It is a key ingredient to draw the attention of your viewers that may eventually convert into likes or subscribes or purchases. Incorporating background music in YouTube videos or private videos is an excellent way to create engaging and compelling content.</p><p>Here’s a quick fact for you!</p><p>Do you know? <em>“13 hours of video content is published every single minute over the renowned YouTube platform!”</em> And a huge chunk of these endearing videos generates a powerful impression on entertained viewers only because of the incorporated catchy background music.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways-to-Choose-the-Right-Background-Music"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-to-Choose-the-Right-Background-Music" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music"></a>Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music</h2><p>Now that you’ve understood that how best background music for videos matters, Step one’s complete.

You wish to paint a wall of your home to serve as an accent. Now, you simply don’t just rush to the Home Depot and start to browse every paint swatch available, right?</p><p>Since there are a million colors and shades available that will simply make you baffled. Eventually, it may take up forever to decide the final one. Instead, what you should actually do is narrow down your search by first deciding the color that you wish to get the accent wall painted with. After that, you then move on to opt for the appropriate shade.</p><p>Likewise, the same principle applies to filter out the background music for your videos. First, you need to understand the occasion that you’re making the video for. Then, you can actually focus on the most suitable beats for your video.</p><h3 id="Understanding-the-occasion"><a href="#Understanding-the-occasion" class="headerlink" title="Understanding the occasion"></a>Understanding the occasion</h3><p>Now, let’s talk about ‘how would you understand what music is appropriate for the occasion?</p><p>Well, that entirely depends on the mood and occasion for which the video is being created.</p><p>Here we have listed some of the vital questions that you must ask yourself when it comes down to understanding the mood and occasion before you begin to opt for the best background music for your video.</p><ul><li>What is the theme&#x2F;occasion&#x2F;topic of your video?</li><li>What sort of emotions do you wish your viewers must feel while watching your video?</li><li>What is the preferred role of the music in your video? Do you want your music to be in the background or at the forefront?</li><li>Most of all, understand your audience. Do some research about what music type they most probably respond to?</li></ul><p>Since the answers can vary depending upon the occasion and the targeted audience. We just can’t answer these for you but yes, we have listed both the most popular and royalty-free background music for videos in the latter part of the article.</p><p>Before we move on to that, let’s first get to know the ideal way to incorporate background music in your videos without any hassles.</p><h2 id="How-to-Add-Background-Music-to-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Add-Background-Music-to-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Add Background Music to Video with Filmora"></a>How to Add Background Music to Video with Filmora</h2><p>Speaking of adding free background music in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, we all look for a better and professional tool that can be of great help and provide a finished output.

You can either get the music from there or if you have already downloaded the music already, get it imported to the Filmora interface and proceed to the next step.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Apart from several features that Filmora offers, one notable benefit is that there is a huge collection of royalty-free audio libraries. This library includes background music and sound effects for different moods&#x2F;genres.</p><p>So, just in case you’re not a pro and can’t find and download music from websites.</p><p>Simply, get into the Audio Library of Filmora and then, opt for the desired music by tapping over the thumbnail in the media pane. To use the music, just drag and drop the required background music to the track in the timeline pane.</p><h3 id="Step-4-Add-video-to-the-timeline-track"><a href="#Step-4-Add-video-to-the-timeline-track" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Add video to the timeline track"></a>Step 4: Add video to the timeline track</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/drag-music-onto-timeline.jpg"                      alt="drag-music-onto-timeline"                ></p><p>Next, you need to drag the imported video available in the User’s Album to the Timeline track. Once you have the video placed in the timeline, proceed with dragging and dropping the required background music for your video to the track above the video track.</p><p>Note: If you’re adding multiple videos to the timeline track, ensure to arrange them according to the play order and without overlapping.</p><p>Just in case the length of the background music is greater than that of your video track, you can trim the music track down and adjust its position to match up with your video length. Also, you can do a real-time check while setting up the position in the previewing window to fine-tune your setting.</p><h3 id="Pro-Tip-for-Editing-Audio"><a href="#Pro-Tip-for-Editing-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip for Editing Audio"></a>Pro Tip for Editing Audio</h3><p>When it comes to editing audio&#x2F;background music, you simply need to double-tap over the music track in the timeline to crop up the audio editing panel. Here, you not just can edit your audio&#x2F;background music but also can add effects like fade in&#x2F;fade out, tune the pitch, adjust volume, set up Audio Equalizer, etc.</p><p>Moreover, with Filmora, you’re also enabled to change the audio speed separately in order to create slow-motion or a fast-forward effect. On top of that, you can even apply the reverse speed effect to playback the music track in reverse.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016143/19272" target="_top" id="2016143">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016143" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016143/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-5-Export-your-video-with-a-music-file"><a href="#Step-5-Export-your-video-with-a-music-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Export your video with a music file"></a>Step 5: Export your video with a music file</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-music-with-video-step.jpg"                      alt="export-music-with-video-step"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151873/7443" target="_top" id="2151873">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151873" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151873/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once you have everything in place and are satisfied with your settings and the result, it’s time to process the video and export it over your computer storage.

Adding finishing touches to make it appear better will surely require knowledge and expertise. More than just <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >adding special effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, another thing that you might want to do is to mute video in specific parts, such as when there is crappy noise.</p><p>There are many instances wherein you will find it practical to mute some parts of the video you are editing. One of the reasons to mute it is when there is crappy noise in the background. The sound of a barking dog, loud footsteps, or rain, among others, can affect the quality of your video. Any distracting or broken sound in the background should be removed so as not to affect the overall quality of the footage negatively. For instance, if the video is an interview of someone and bad words or potentially offensive statements have been uttered, you might also find it practical to mute the video. If you plan to embed <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >background music <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, muting the audio will also be beneficial.</p><h2 id="How-to-Mute-Audio-from-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#How-to-Mute-Audio-from-Video-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="How to Mute Audio from Video with Wondershare Filmora"></a>How to Mute Audio from Video with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Generally speaking, there are two ways by which the software can be used.</p><p><strong><em>To begin with, get a free trial copy of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</em></strong></p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a class="link"   href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg" >Download Mac Version <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p><p><strong>Methode 1</strong>: The first one is through using the <strong>“</strong> <strong>Mute”</strong> feature.

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p><h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p><h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p><p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p><h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Well, it is the audio ducking action. So, if this concept terms out to be new for you, you are on the right page.</p><p>Audio ducking is an off-screen hidden vital phenomenon. It is no more challenging to pick yourself the best <strong>audio ducking software</strong> to do wonders in editing the audios we have brought the best five audio ducking software that you should know of 2020!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-audio-ducking.jpg"                      alt="audio ducking"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is Audio Ducking?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 5 Audio Ducking Software</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#What-is-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="What is Audio Ducking?"></a>What is Audio Ducking?</h2><p>Do you wish to go live with beautiful background music, interactive sessions, or a fun party time? Many of you would have heard of this <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >audio ducking mechanism <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as video creators and audio spectators. But, let me introduce it for better understanding.</p><p>Audio ducking is a mechanism where the background audio is ducked anytime or compressed temporally if any dual audio is detected or present. Especially in a live session like an emcee, this method helps lower the music when the person starts speaking and rises again when the person finishes. Beyond live sessions, ducking is in narrations, translations, and podcasts as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-ducking-software.jpg"                      alt="audio ducking software"                ></p><p><em>Source: pro.harman.com</em></p><p>In technical terms, ducking is a sidechain compression where the secondary audio channel takes control over or compresses another channel. If the control channel threshold exceeds, the audio channel lowers, leaving no trace of background audio, and when the point drops, the background audio levels up again. Such chains or compression is a manual job using signal compressors, portable PAs, and Ui24R.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997680/19272" target="_top" id="1997680">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997680" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997680/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-5-Audio-Ducking-Software"><a href="#Top-5-Audio-Ducking-Software" class="headerlink" title="Top 5 Audio Ducking Software"></a>Top 5 Audio Ducking Software</h2><p>While much audio ducking software promises seamless and efficient usage, we picked the five best that do a great job.

In the coming part, we are going to share 7 tips that will aid in making creative slideshows.</p><h3 id="1-Minimalism"><a href="#1-Minimalism" class="headerlink" title="1. Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148644/16836" target="_top" id="2148644">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148644" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148644/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry" class="headerlink" title="4. Alignment and Symmetry"></a>4. Alignment and Symmetry</h3><p>While making your slides, one key factor that can either make or break your presentation is consistency and alignment. You should never present a rough slide. Always align the text, images, and headings of your slides. Symmetry and consistency are also very important. Follow the same consistent pattern in all slides.</p><h3 id="5-Formatting-and-Settings"><a href="#5-Formatting-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="5. Formatting and Settings"></a>5. Formatting and Settings</h3><p>Making your slides creative doesn’t mean making them like a rainbow. Simplicity has its own magic and grace. The more your slide is simple and clean, the more readable it is. You should always keep simple colors for text and headings.</p><p>Playing with different fonts and styles for headings might also disturb your presentation visually. Selecting the correct font size, style with appropriate colors is essential.</p><h3 id="6-Add-and-Adjust"><a href="#6-Add-and-Adjust" class="headerlink" title="6. Add and Adjust"></a>6. Add and Adjust</h3><p>Always follow the ‘Add and Adjust’ policy. You should never throw data and elements on the slides and present them. The best practice is to add the content, the images and then adjust everything. You should always arrange the text in bullets with proper headings.</p><p>For the case of an image, you should add it, inspect it and if needed, crop it. Adding things with perfection makes your presentation stand out and shine differently.</p><h3 id="7-Animation"><a href="#7-Animation" class="headerlink" title="7. Animation"></a>7. Animation</h3><p>Static slides are too mainstream for today’s fast world. The last tip to make creative slides that can retain your audiences’ attention is animation. By adding a few animated elements to your presentation makes it look classy and quirky. With animation, you can also maintain the interest of your audience.</p><h3 id="Last-Words"><a href="#Last-Words" class="headerlink" title="Last Words"></a>Last Words</h3><p>The article has discussed in detail that how someone could record a voice-over PowerPoint. A complete step-by-step guideline has been shared for both Mac and Windows users on audio recording with PowerPoint. We also talked about 7 tips that will surely improve the quality of your slides.</p><p>By using the right and effective tool, you can still make creative slides without bothering to follow any tips.

Minimalism"></a>1. Minimalism</h3><p>The most crucial tip when it comes to making creative slides is the amount of information. It is said that ‘Less is More.’ While making your slides, you should always add less information to the slides, and you should speak more.</p><p>The slides must contain minimal data. Too many wordy slides look boring, and they can never sustain your audiences’ interest. So, it is best suggested to add less and make your slides neat and spacious.</p><h3 id="2-Use-Design-Elements-3"><a href="#2-Use-Design-Elements-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Use Design Elements"></a>2. Use Design Elements</h3><p>Adding stock images and background images is a very common trend for making slides. A tip that will make your slides unique and equally attractive is design elements. Choosing a bold color for the background and then adding elements to it makes them shine. The elements dominate on a strong colored background. Images can never be this dominating or expressive.</p><p>Also, changing the common trends will make your presentation different and classic as compared to regularly designed slides.</p><h3 id="3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3"><a href="#3-One-Story-at-a-Time-3" class="headerlink" title="3. One Story at a Time"></a>3. One Story at a Time</h3><p>A very common mistake that people generally make because they are unaware of it is the content. The best practice for quality presentation slides is to add and discuss one story per slide. You should never confuse your audience by sharing multiple things from the same slide.</p><p>If you plan to discuss various things, then make separate slides for each story. This way, the audience gets sufficient time to digest and understand one story before moving on to another.</p><h3 id="4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3"><a href="#4-Alignment-and-Symmetry-3" class="headerlink" title="4.
