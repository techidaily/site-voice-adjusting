Making music videos that really stand out in the sea of similar content is far from easy, but if you are not a professional filmmaker, and you would just like to make a video quickly you can try creating music videos you share on social networks with a music visualizer. Most of the music visualizers you can find online enable you to select an <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >audio spectrum template <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, pick the style of the visualization or even add logos or links to your social media accounts. So, in this article we are going to take you through the five best music visualizers you can use to create music videos that are going to get a lot of likes and shares on social media in 2024. You will learn:</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part 1: What Is Music Visualization?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part 2: How Does Music Visualization Work?</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part 3: Best Music Visualizers in 2024</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part4"><strong>Part 4: Easier Ways to Create Music Visualization Videos</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Music-Visualization"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Music-Visualization" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Music Visualization?"></a>Part 1: What Is Music Visualization?</h2><p>The conversion of sounds into imagery is often referred to as music visualization, and since the mid-1970 a number of different electronic and media player software visualizers have been used to generate animated images from a musical composition.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Does-Music-Visualization-Work"><a href="#Part-2-How-Does-Music-Visualization-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Does Music Visualization Work?"></a>Part 2: How Does Music Visualization Work?</h2><p>The techniques used to visualize sound can vary from very simple ones like a simulation of an oscilloscope display, to highly complex ones that involve a number of composite effects. Media players like Winamp or VLC have built-in sound visualization features that are based on the song’s frequency spectrum and loudness. Nearly all music visualizations take place in real-time, which is the reason why VJ artists often use music visualization software to create their artwork. However, over the course of the last couple of decades, music visualization has gotten so popular that in 2019 you can even visualize your favorite songs online, without the use of any additional software.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Best-Music-Visualizers-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-Best-Music-Visualizers-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Best Music Visualizers in 2024"></a>Part 3: Best Music Visualizers in 2024</h2><p>If you already have the music you would like to visualize, then it is time for you to start browsing through some of the best music visualizers that are currently available on the markets. Nearly all of the music visualizers we featured in this article offer free trial versions that have a limited scope of visualization and exporting options, but enable you to see if the music visualizer meets all of your demands. Let’s have a look at the five best music visualizers of 2024.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Best 5 Music Visualizers</th><th>Pricing</th><th>Compatiblity</th><th>Features</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Renderforest Music Visualizer</td><td>$9.99 per month</td><td>Online</td><td>Visualization templates</td></tr><tr><td>Videobolt Music Visualizer</td><td>$7.99 per month</td><td>Online</td><td>Template customization</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Music Visuals</td><td>$44,95 for a full version license</td><td>Windows&#x2F;macOS</td><td>Generate 2D and 3D graphics</td></tr><tr><td>VSDC Free Video Editor</td><td>Free</td><td>Windows</td><td>Audio Spectrum Visualizer</td></tr><tr><td>After Effects</td><td>$20,99 per month</td><td>Windows&#x2F;macOS</td><td>Audio Spectrum Effect</td></tr><tr><td>Media</td><td>Free</td><td>Online</td><td>Audio Spectrum Visualizer</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-Renderforest-Music-Visualizer"><a href="#1-Renderforest-Music-Visualizer" class="headerlink" title="1. Renderforest Music Visualizer"></a>1. Renderforest Music Visualizer</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free version available, subscription plans start at $9.99</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Online</p><p>Renderforest is a platform that helps its users create visual content online, or even design an entire website. However, in order to start visualizing your music with Renderforest, you must first register and create your own account. Afterward, you just have to choose between visualization templates with text or photo holders, add the artist’s name and the title of the song and add the background photo or video. You can then proceed to pick the style of the visualization that matches the music perfectly, select its color and finally upload a song you would like to use in your video. When done, you should simply click on the Preview icon and the Renderforest will send you the email that contains the music visualization video. Keep in mind that all videos created with the free version of the platform are going to be watermarked and that their duration can’t exceed a one-minute limit.</p><h4 id="2-Videobolt-Music-Visualizer"><a href="#2-Videobolt-Music-Visualizer" class="headerlink" title="2. Videobolt Music Visualizer"></a>2. Videobolt Music Visualizer</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, Subscription plans start from $7.99 per month</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Online</p><p>The collection of music visualization templates this website offers is truly impressive, as you can choose from a wide variety of templates during the process of creating a video. However, you must purchase one of the available subscription plans in order to be able to customize the template you’ve selected and export a watermark-free video. After you’ve selected a music visualization template you just have to click on the Edit button below it to start working on your project. You can either upload a song from your computer or use SoundCloud to import a song you would like to visualize into the project. Adding cover art or using a variation of the template you originally selected can improve the quality of your video. The only downside is that you won’t be able to customize videos produced by Videobolt Music Visualizer during the free trial period.</p><h4 id="3-Magic-Music-Visuals"><a href="#3-Magic-Music-Visuals" class="headerlink" title="3. Magic Music Visuals"></a>3. Magic Music Visuals</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free demo available, $44,95 for a full version license</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>VJs and all other artists who like to mix sound and images during live sessions can use the Performer edition of this cross-platform music visualization software. The Studio edition offers all features that are necessary for the creation of real-time music visualizations or music videos. You can use both editions of Magic to generate 2D and 3D graphics that react to the music or mix together photos, 3D files or videos. Moreover, you can easily enter the full-screen mode and project your videos using LED displays or projectors. The Magic Music Visuals also enables its users to combine an unlimited number of audio inputs simultaneously, which means that you can mix two or more songs effortlessly. This music visualization software lets you export videos in mp4 and mov files, but the length of the rendering process depends on how long the video is and on the processing power of the computer you’re using.</p><h4 id="4-VSDC-Video-Editor-Free-Audio-Spectrum-Visualizer"><a href="#4-VSDC-Video-Editor-Free-Audio-Spectrum-Visualizer" class="headerlink" title="4. VSDC Video Editor Free - Audio Spectrum Visualizer"></a>4. VSDC Video Editor Free - Audio Spectrum Visualizer</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Windows</p><p>Visualizing music is just one out of countless video editing options VDSC Video Editor Free offers. Besides the creation of videos based on music, you can also use this video editing software product to stabilize videos recorded with action cameras, enhance the colors in the footage captured with a wide array of cameras and drones, create 3D charts or export videos in high resolution to your accounts on social media directly from the software. The editor’s audio visualizer contains five hundred presets you can use to create a captivating music video for your latest song. Besides the Spectrum feature that displays the sounds within a set color range, the VDSC Video Editor also offers the Audio Abstraction option that generates colorful abstract shapes based on the music you select. Even though visualizing sound with VDSC’s audio visualizer is a fun and simple process, video creators with no previous video editing experience may need a little time to get used to the software’s interface.</p><h4 id="5-After-Effects-The-Audio-Spectrum-Effect"><a href="#5-After-Effects-The-Audio-Spectrum-Effect" class="headerlink" title="5. After Effects - The Audio Spectrum Effect"></a>5. After Effects - The Audio Spectrum Effect</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20,99 per month as a single app or $52,99 as a part of the All Apps subscription model</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>There isn’t virtually anything related to digital visual effects, motion graphics or compositing you can’t do in Adobe After Effects. That is why it is hardly surprising that you can also use the After Effects to visualize the music, but you must have at least basic knowledge of the software in order to be able to that. Before you can apply the Audio Spectrum effect you must first create a new composition, add the sound file to that composition and set its duration. If these tasks sound too complicated, you should take your time and slowly learn how to use the basic functionalities of Adobe After Effects. More experienced video editors can use The Audio Spectrum effect’s settings to try out different styles of music visualization and explore creative ways of making their videos more dynamic.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Create-Audio-Spectrum-Visualizer-Video-in-Filmora-Video-Editor-Step-by-Step"><a href="#Part-4-Create-Audio-Spectrum-Visualizer-Video-in-Filmora-Video-Editor-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Create Audio Spectrum Visualizer Video in Filmora Video Editor [Step by Step]"></a>Part 4: Create Audio Spectrum Visualizer Video in Filmora Video Editor [Step by Step]</h2><p>There is much software to add audio spectrum visualizer to video.

What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor"></a>Part 1. What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor</h2><p>Have you ever looked at the internet and the number of options you get whenever you search for MP3 tag editor Mac free? The page is all packed and loaded with tons of different options. No doubt it’s tough to select a good tag editor, but what if we tell you some tricks for selecting a great Mac music tag editor? Without any further delay, let’s begin.</p><h3 id="·-Easy-to-User-Interface-3"><a href="#·-Easy-to-User-Interface-3" class="headerlink" title="· Easy to User Interface"></a>· Easy to User Interface</h3><p>A primary factor that is considered while selecting any tool, the editor, is its interface. If any software offers a complex interface, users don’t prefer it. An easy interface means all the editing, manipulating, adding, deleting options appear on the front. Users don’t have to struggle to find basic options.</p><h3 id="·-Online-Database-Search-3"><a href="#·-Online-Database-Search-3" class="headerlink" title="· Online Database Search"></a>· Online Database Search</h3><p>If any macOS MP3 tag editor offers an online database search means it’s a good editor. This is because not all editors support online search. The option is very helpful as the online search shares all the information related to any searched tag.</p><h3 id="·-Editing-Options-3"><a href="#·-Editing-Options-3" class="headerlink" title="· Editing Options"></a>· Editing Options</h3><p>How many editing options do you prefer? Editing metadata means that you should be able to edit and manipulate as many fields as possible. For instance, the Mac music tag editor should allow changing the singer’s name, year tag, and all the other fields.</p><h3 id="·-Batch-Processing-3"><a href="#·-Batch-Processing-3" class="headerlink" title="· Batch Processing"></a>· Batch Processing</h3><p>Editing is a stressful and hectic job. Is there a way to help yourself? Let’s share about Batch Processing. If the Mac MP3 tag editor allows batch processing, then it’s a great choice. This is because editing individually can take hours, but batch processing reduces the editing time as well as the editing efforts.</p><h3 id="·-Supported-Formats-3"><a href="#·-Supported-Formats-3" class="headerlink" title="· Supported Formats"></a>· Supported Formats</h3><p>How many formats can your Mac music tag editor support? Although all the tools are MP3 tag editors, not all audio files have MP3 format. For this reason, always select the tag editor that can support and edit different files formats.</p><h2 id="Part-2-5-Recommended-Mac-MP3-Tag-Editor-3"><a href="#Part-2-5-Recommended-Mac-MP3-Tag-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor"></a>Part 2. 5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor</h2><p>After talking about the options to consider before selecting any macOS MP3 tag editor, it’s the perfect time to share some tag editors with all the Mac users.

Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free. That’s why, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online tools that allow you to separate audio from video files in just a few easy steps.</p><h2 id="Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors"><a href="#Top-6-Online-Audio-Extractors" class="headerlink" title="Top 6 Online Audio Extractors"></a>Top 6 Online Audio Extractors</h2><p>The limitations in terms of size and file format can narrow down your choices of online audio extractors. So, before you decide which platform you are going to use, you must first check the size and file format of your video. Let’s take a look at some of the best online audio extractors you can use to create high-quality audio files for free.</p><h4 id="2-Online-Audio-Converter"><a href="#2-Online-Audio-Converter" class="headerlink" title="2. Online Audio Converter"></a>2. Online Audio Converter</h4><p>The wide range of supported file formats, as well as the straightforward audio extraction process, make this platform one the best choices for anyone who wants to create an audio file from a video. The maximum size of the video file you can upload to Online Audio Converter is <strong>2048mb</strong>, which means that you can even convert high-resolution files that last more than just a few minutes. Once you’ve uploaded a video file from your computer, <strong>Google Drive, Dropbox</strong> or some other online destination, you just have to select the <strong>output format</strong> and <strong>the quality</strong> of the audio file. Optionally, you can click on <strong>the Advanced settings option</strong> if you would like to add <strong>fade in and fade out effects</strong>, try to <strong>remove voice</strong> or change the <strong>bitrates and sample rates</strong>. Click on the <strong>Convert button</strong> when ready and proceed to <strong>save the file</strong> to your computer or at some online destination.</p><h4 id="3-AudioExtracter"><a href="#3-AudioExtracter" class="headerlink" title="3. AudioExtracter"></a>3. AudioExtracter</h4><p>This platform enables you to convert video files to audio files <strong>automatically</strong>, but it also offers a variety of <strong>video, photo and audio editing tools</strong> you can use free of charge. You just have to upload a file, in <strong>MP4, AVI</strong> or any other commonly used video file formats, that is smaller than <strong>500mb</strong> and AudioExtracter will convert your video into an MP3 audio file you can save to your computer. The only downside is that you can’t choose an <strong>output format, readjust the bitrate and select the quality of the audio file</strong> you are creating, which can significantly restrict your options. The platform also offers a new feature that enables you to <strong>convert YouTube videos into MP3 files,</strong> so that you can save all your favorite songs as audio files on your computer.</p><h4 id="4-Online-Video-Converter"><a href="#4-Online-Video-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4. Online Video Converter"></a>4. Online Video Converter</h4><p>Online Video Converter supports almost all video file formats, which means that you can extract audio files from virtually any video clip, but keep in mind that the maximum size of the file you’d like to convert can’t exceed the <strong>1000mb limit</strong>. The audio extraction process is rather simple as you just have to <strong>upload the file</strong> and wait for the platform to prepare your file for conversion. Afterward, you just have to <strong>select the output format</strong> and click on the <strong>Start button</strong> and once the conversion process is completed, you can save the file to a destination on your device or use the <strong>QR code</strong> to download it to a <strong>Smartphone or tablet</strong>. What’s more, you can also use the <strong>Online Video Converter</strong> to extract audio files from <a class="link"   href="https://www.onlinevideoconverter.com/mp3-converter" >YouTube videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Simply paste the video’s URL and then proceeds to choose the output format, and click on the <strong>More Settings</strong> option if you want to designate <strong>the start and end points</strong> of the new audio file. Click on the <strong>Start button</strong> to commence the extraction process and use one of the available methods to download the file.</p><h4 id="5-Video2Mp3"><a href="#5-Video2Mp3" class="headerlink" title="5. Video2Mp3"></a>5. Video2Mp3</h4><p>YouTubers who already have channels on the world’s largest video sharing platform can use the Video2Mp3 tool to turn their videos into MP3 files effortlessly. You don’t even have to be a registered YouTube user to convert videos stored on this platform with Video2Mp3, because you can just pick any video that is uploaded to YouTube and turn it into an MP3 file with this powerful audio extraction tool. Once you’ve pasted the video’s <strong>URL into the platform’s URL box</strong>, simply click on the Convert to MP3 button. You will then have to specify the preferred <strong>output format</strong>, or use the platform’s <strong>Search and Convert</strong> option that lets you search for videos on <strong>Dailymotion, Clipfish or YouTube</strong> and convert them. Click on the <strong>Convert button</strong> to initiate the conversion process, <strong>insert the name of the artist and title</strong> of the song you’re converting and proceed to download the video.</p><h4 id="6-Zamzar"><a href="#6-Zamzar" class="headerlink" title="6. Zamzar"></a>6. Zamzar</h4><p>You can convert a video file with Zamzar in just three quick steps, upload a file from an online destination or from your device, <strong>pick the output format</strong> and click on the Convert button. Once the file is converted you can save it to your computer, however, the free version of the Zamzar platform offers only limited options. In case you would like to be able to convert files that are <strong>larger than 200mb</strong>, be able to <strong>convert via email</strong>, have access to <strong>online storage space</strong>, then you should <strong>choose one of the available subscription plans</strong>. Keep in mind that all versions of the platform <strong>limit the concurrent number of conversions</strong>, which means that even if you purchase a subscription plan, you are going to be able to make <strong>25, 50 or 100</strong> concurrent conversions each month, depending on the plan you choose.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get :</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 Audio Recording Software to Capture Your Voice Easily <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Creating audio files from videos you record with your phones and digital cameras doesn’t require a lot of effort since online audio extractors enable you to complete the entire process in just a couple of minutes.

The importance of sound for the overall quality of a video is often overlooked by young filmmakers, as they tend to dedicate all of their attention to the visual part of their projects.</p><p>The fact of the matter is that even a minor error in the video’s soundtrack can distract the viewer and ruin a video completely. That’s why, in this article, we are going to show you four different methods of adjusting the audio volume in Filmora.</p><p>To increse the volume of your video, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >click here. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Four-Ways-of-Adjusting-Audio-Volume-in-Filmora"><a href="#Four-Ways-of-Adjusting-Audio-Volume-in-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Four Ways of Adjusting Audio Volume in Filmora"></a>Four Ways of Adjusting Audio Volume in Filmora</h2><p>The audio clips often have different volume levels, so in order to create a balanced soundtrack, you have to adjust the volume of each audio track you intend to use in your projects. Filmora offers several different ways to adjust the volume of audio files quickly and effortlessly. Here’s how you can increase or decrease the volume of the audio clips in Filmora.</p><p>Download Filmora and watch the video below to get a full knowledge abtou adjusting volume<img src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" alt="![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) "> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h4 id="1-Changing-the-Audio-Volume-of-Entire-Track"><a href="#1-Changing-the-Audio-Volume-of-Entire-Track" class="headerlink" title="1. Changing the Audio Volume of Entire Track"></a>1. Changing the Audio Volume of Entire Track</h4><p>This is probably the easiest and fastest way to adjust the volume of a video or an audio file in Filmora. After you import the file into a project you just have to add it to a certain position on the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging and dropping the file at the location on the timeline where you want the file to be placed. Click on the <strong>Add Track menu</strong> that is located in the upper left corner of the timeline and select the <strong>Big option</strong> from the <strong>Adjust Track Height</strong> submenu.</p><p>Enlarging the video and audio tracks will enable you to see the <strong>audio volume line</strong> that is displayed over all clips that contain sound you add to the timeline. <strong>Click on the line and drag it upwards if you would like to increase the volume or drag it downwards if you want to decrease the volume of an audio or a video file.</strong></p><h4 id="2-Applying-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Change-the-Audio-Volume-Partially"><a href="#2-Applying-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Change-the-Audio-Volume-Partially" class="headerlink" title="2. Applying the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Change the Audio Volume Partially"></a>2. Applying the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Change the Audio Volume Partially</h4><p>Once you add an audio clip to an audio track on Filmora’s timeline, you can adjust its volume from the <strong>Audio Editing panel.</strong> Double-clicking on an audio file will bring up the Audio Editing panel that contains <strong>Fade In and Fade Out</strong> sliders. Both sliders are going to be set to zero by default, so you just have to drag each of them to the right in order to create the Fade In or Fade Out effect.</p><p>Filmora also lets you create the Fade In and Fade Out effect directly from the timeline, as you just have to <strong>hover</strong> <strong>the mouse over an audio file and drag the Fade In or Fade Out markers</strong> to set the duration of the effect for that particular file.</p><h4 id="3-Using-the-Volume-Slider-to-Change-the-Audio-Volume"><a href="#3-Using-the-Volume-Slider-to-Change-the-Audio-Volume" class="headerlink" title="3. Using the Volume Slider to Change the Audio Volume"></a>3. Using the Volume Slider to Change the Audio Volume</h4><p>On the left side of the Audio Editing panel that can be accessed by double clicking on an audio file, you will be able to see the <strong>volume slider.</strong> Its value is going to be set to <strong>0 dB</strong> by default and you just have to <strong>drag it upward or downward</strong> in order to adjust the audio volume. As you drag the slider the new audio volume value is going to be displayed in a box below the slider.

Even so, adding music to a video online is a straightforward process that doesn’t require you to have advanced video editing skills. So, let’s take a look at different ways of adding music to videos online for free.</p><h3 id="1-Add-Music-and-Sound-Effect-to-Videos-in-YouTube-Studio"><a href="#1-Add-Music-and-Sound-Effect-to-Videos-in-YouTube-Studio" class="headerlink" title="1. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio"></a>1. Add Music and Sound Effect to Videos in YouTube Studio</h3><p>A few years ago, YouTube launched YouTube Studio that enables YouTubers to edit their videos after they’ve uploaded them to channels. The YouTube Studio currently doesn’t offer audio editing tools, although it features both music and audio effects libraries.</p><p>There are two different ways to add music to a video with a YouTube studio. After you upload a video file to your channel, unlisted it and then open the <strong>Creator Studio Classic</strong> tab which is located in the lower-left side of the page. You should select the Videos option under the Video Manager menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-youtube-video-2.jpg"                      alt="Add Music to YouTube Video"                ></p><p>Select Audio Option</p><p>Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> drop-down menu next to the video to which you would like to add music and choose the <strong>Audio</strong> option. Start browsing through YouTube’s collection of royalty-free music and click on the <strong>ADD TO VIDEO</strong> button once you find a song that matches your video. You can use the Audio Saturation slider to decide if you want to favor the original sound of the video or the song you just added. Click on the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button when you are done and YouTube Studio will add the music to your video.</p><p>You can check the detailed information about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >how to add music to YouTube video here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/youtube-audio-library-free-music-sound-effect.jpg"                      alt="Use Audio in YouTube Audio Library"                ></p><p>YouTube Audio Library Interface</p><p>Optionally you can also download music and audio effects from YouTube Studio’s Audio Library first, and then add the downloaded music to videos with the video editor you have installed on your computer.</p><h3 id="3-Use-Veed-io-to-Add-Music-to-Videos"><a href="#3-Use-Veed-io-to-Add-Music-to-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.

You should simply select if you want to upload a file from your computer, a camera, your Dropbox account or via a link and wait for your video to be uploaded. Keep in mind that you cannot upload video files <strong>larger than 50mb</strong> if you are using the free version of the platform.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/veed.io-add-music-to-video-editing-interface.jpg"                      alt="Add and Edit Audio in Vdeed.io online"                ></p><p>Veed.io audio uploading and editing interface</p><p>After the upload of the video is completed you should click on the Audio icon that is located on the toolbar.

Import the targeted video clips to initiate the process. Select the videos whose audio has to be extracted. Head to the ‘Clip’ section and choose ‘Audio Options.’ Hit ‘Extract Audio’ afterward.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/detach-audio-in-premiere-pro-2.jpg"                      alt="select extract audio option"                ></p><p>Step 3: File Extraction</p><p>In a couple of seconds, Premiere Pro creates duplicate audio files. The original video clips are not affected in any way. Moving on, let us move on to export the extracted audio clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/detach-audio-in-premiere-pro-3.jpg"                      alt="extracted audio clips created"                ></p><p>Step 4: Exporting Process</p><p>Mark in and out points on your sequence for the session you wish to export.

Going the extra mile and doing all you can to produce videos that are going to attract the attention of online viewers can prove beneficial for numerous reasons.</p><p>Editing videos to the beat of the music in Final Cut Pro and other non-linear video editing apps can be a good way to create potentially viral videos. That’s why in this article we are going to show you how you can sync video to the music beat and make dynamic videos in Final Cut Pro X.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Make Beats for Your Music Videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="How-to-Sync-Videos-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Three-Different-Ways"><a href="#How-to-Sync-Videos-to-the-Beat-of-a-Song-in-Three-Different-Ways" class="headerlink" title="How to Sync Videos to the Beat of a Song in Three Different Ways"></a>How to Sync Videos to the Beat of a Song in Three Different Ways</h2><p>Editing a video to the beat of a song requires some previous preparation because you must have all the materials in place before you start adding footage to the FCPX’s timeline. Most importantly the song you choose as a soundtrack for your video needs to have a rhythm you can use to easily sync videos and make cuts so that they match the song’s beat perfectly. So let’s have a look at three different techniques you can use to edit to the beat of a song.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/sync.png"                      alt="sync"                ></p><h3 id="Add-Markers-Manually-and-Snap-Videos-to-the-Beats-of-a-Song"><a href="#Add-Markers-Manually-and-Snap-Videos-to-the-Beats-of-a-Song" class="headerlink" title="Add Markers Manually and Snap Videos to the Beats of a Song"></a>Add Markers Manually and Snap Videos to the Beats of a Song</h3><p>Once you’ve imported all of your footage into a project you created in FCPX, you should place the song you want to use in your video to the audio track on the timeline. You must then isolate the audio file by either clicking on the <strong>Solo icon</strong> that looks like headphones on the editor’s timeline, selecting the Solo option from the Clip menu or using the <strong>OPTION + S</strong> keyboard shortcut.</p><p>Play the audio file you isolated and start adding markers at the beats in the songs where you want to make cuts. It is worth noting that you don’t have to add a marker at each beat, and you should listen to the song a few times in order to find perfect spots where you are going to make the cuts. Place the playhead at the beginning of the audio file, click on the <strong>Play button</strong>, and press the <strong>M key</strong> to start adding markers. You can count on the beat or tap your foot in order to make keeping up with the pace of the beats easier. Switching to the waveform view can also help you add markers more accurately and reduce the amount of time you have to spend searching for a beat.</p><p>Proceed to <strong>disable the Solo option</strong> after you add all markers to the song, and use the <strong>N keyboard shortcut</strong> to activate the <strong>Snapping feature</strong> before you add video clips to the timeline.

Click on the <strong>Titles and Generators icon</strong> and then place the <strong>Custom generator</strong> to the video track on the timeline.</p><p>You should then add the song you want to use in your video to the audio track, connect it to the Custom generator and make sure that the duration of these two files matches. Listen to the song a few times before selecting both the generator and the audio file and then hold the <strong>Command button and press the B button</strong> to make cuts at beats throughout the song.</p><p>Drag a video clip from the Media Library and hold it over the section of the Custom generator until you see the <strong>Film Strip icon</strong>. Drop the video clip and select either the <strong>Replace from Start, Replace from End or Replace with Retime to Fit</strong> options. Keep adding video clips to this until you replace all parts of the generator with the footage you want to include in your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Enhance2.jpg"                      alt="Enhance2"                ></p><p>You can also delete cuts you’ve made on the generator by simply selecting the start or the end of a generator clip and pressing the delete button on the keyboard. Choose the Replace with Retime to Fit option in case a video clip is shorter than the segment of the generator you are trying to replace. FCPX will automatically slow down your clip and extend it to fit between two cuts. Optionally, you can use the Trim tool to align your cuts to the beats of the song perfectly, if they are a bit off, before previewing and exporting the video you created.</p><p>Click here to learn more about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Sync Audio and Video in Final Cut Pro X 2021. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Generate-Beat-Markers-Automatically-with-BeatMark-X-App"><a href="#Generate-Beat-Markers-Automatically-with-BeatMark-X-App" class="headerlink" title="Generate Beat Markers Automatically with BeatMark X App"></a>Generate Beat Markers Automatically with BeatMark X App</h3><p>Adding markers to each beat of the song manually can be a painstakingly lengthy process, especially if you would like to create a video that lasts longer than a few minutes.

Very few people think of audio editing when they talk about AE, even though this application offers a simple way to add Fade in and fade out effects to audio files used in soundtracks.</p><p>However, you will need to have at least basic video and sound editing skills to fade in and fade out audio files in AE since the app doesn’t offer a preset that you can drag and drop to the timeline. So, in this article, we will show how to create the Fade in and fade out effects in Adobe After Effects in just a few simple steps.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Audio Mixer Software to Trim Your Sound Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE"><a href="#Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE"></a>Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects"></a>Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects</h3><p>Once you’ve created a new project in AE and you’ve imported the audio files you’d like to include in the soundtrack of the video you’re making, you should place that audio file on the timeline. Click on the arrow located next to the audio file, then click on the Audio arrow that will be displayed under the file, and finally click on the Waveform arrow. This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you’d like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision. The file you added to your composition will be displayed as a layer in the Composition tab located in the lower-left region of the software’s interface.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fade-out-in-audio-after-effects-waveform.jpg" alt="fade out/in audio waveform after effects"></p><h3 id="Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file"><a href="#Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file"></a>Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file</h3><p>The next thing you will have to do is place the playhead at the exact location where you want the Fade In effect to start. In most cases, Fade effects are added at the starting point of the audio file, so you should position the playhead at the beginning of the timeline or zero seconds. You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last. If you don’t know how to use keyframes in After Effects, <a class="link"   href="https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/how-to-set-keyframes-after-effects" >this article will give you some info <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/add-keyframe-fade-in-out-audio.jpg" alt="Add keyframe to fade out/in audio"></p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >15 Free After Effects Templates to Power up Your Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Step-3-Complete-Fade-out-in-audio-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Step-3-Complete-Fade-out-in-audio-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Complete Fade out&#x2F;in audio in After Effects"></a>Step 3: Complete Fade out&#x2F;in audio in After Effects</h3><p>Move the playhead to the location where you want the effect to end and add another keyframe by clicking on the ‘Add or remove keyframe at current time’ icon. Set the Audio Level value to 0db, and that is it. You’ve created the Fade in effect. Keep in mind that you can use more than two keyframes to fade in audio, enabling you to increase the audio level gradually. The process of creating the Fade effect requires you to add a keyframe that has a 0db value a few seconds before the clip ends and then add another keyframe at the very end of the audio file that has -50 or -100db audio level value.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/complete-fade-iin-out-audio-after-effects.jpg" alt="Complete fade out/in audio in After Effects"></p><h2 id="Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects"><a href="#Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects"></a>Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects</h2><p>The process of creating a fade in or a fade out effect in AE is quite simple, but it is up to you to discover creative ways of using these effects. Here are a few tips that can help you use these audio effects more creatively.</p><h3 id="1-Avoid-Hard-Cuts"><a href="#1-Avoid-Hard-Cuts" class="headerlink" title="1. Avoid Hard Cuts"></a>1. Avoid Hard Cuts</h3><p>A high pitch sound at the very begging of a new sequence can ruin your soundtrack and ultimately the entire video, so in case you’ve cut an audio file at the location where the sound peaks, you can apply a fade in effect to make the transition between two audio files softer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Cut Video in After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression"><a href="#2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression" class="headerlink" title="2. Be Mindful of Audio Compression"></a>2. Be Mindful of Audio Compression</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://theproaudiofiles.com/compression-techniques/" >Audio compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a process that reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet sounds, resulting from the audio file’s dynamic range being compressed. In most cases, you won’t notice the effects of audio compression, but if you compress an audio file too much, you might get some unwanted side effects if you add a fade out effect to that file. That’s why it is best to rely on the default audio compression features a video or audio editing app offers.</p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively"><a href="#3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively"></a>3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively</h3><p>Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn’t require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value. However, finding the best way to improve the quality of your soundtrack by applying these effects may take some practice. Do you often add Fade in and fade out audio effects in AE?

Rhythm and Tempo</h3><p>The most significant thing to notice is the rhythm and tempo of the music. The instrumental music comes at different speeds.

However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren’t enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can’t listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to <strong>increase volume</strong> on your windows without speakers.</p><p>There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and <strong>booster volume</strong> and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.</p><p>Here in this article is a discussion about how to help <strong>boost volume</strong> as desired on your computer.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora</a></li></ul><h2 id="Method-1-Boost-volume-by-Native-Windows-Volume-Booster"><a href="#Method-1-Boost-volume-by-Native-Windows-Volume-Booster" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster"></a>Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster</h2><p>Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.</p><p>1. Click the <strong>Control Panel</strong> by typing <strong>Control</strong> at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer’s audio hardware.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg"                      alt="hardware and sound"                ></p><p>2. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you’ve enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg"                      alt="select spatial sound"                ></p><p>3.

This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-bass-boost-settings.jpg"                      alt="bass boost settings"                ></p><p>4. To get to the Windows <strong>Video Playback</strong> settings, click the <strong>Settings</strong>, then <strong>Apps</strong>, then <strong>Video Playback</strong>, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg"                      alt="video playback settings"                ></p><p>5. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-hd-color-settings.jpg"                      alt="hd color settings"                ></p><h2 id="Method-2-Boost-sound-by-Equalizer-APO-Application"><a href="#Method-2-Boost-sound-by-Equalizer-APO-Application" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application"></a>Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application</h2><p>Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.</p><p>1. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg"                      alt="equalizer application menu"                ></p><p>2. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-apply-equalizer.jpg"                      alt="apply equalizer"                ></p><p>3. The arrow mentioned in the below picture can change <strong>booster sound</strong>. The sound wave will shift, and the maximum will come out; just split it with an equalizer, so it’s probably best to lower the boost to avoid cutting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-change-booster-sound.jpg"                      alt="change booster-sound"                ></p><p>4. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins&#x2F;VST plugin.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-insert-limiter.jpg"                      alt="insert limiter"                ></p><p>5. The VST container will be inserted at the end of the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-vst-container.jpg"                      alt="vst container"                ></p><p>6. Hit upon the file option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-hit-file-option.jpg"                      alt="hit file option"                ></p><p>7. Click the VST file when the VST preview window opens (extension .dll). VST 2 is the only format that is supported. Because there is no connection feature, you must use VST with the same number of items as Equalizer APO. Now VST can be loaded.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-load-vst-equalizer.jpg"                      alt="load vst equalizer"                ></p><p>8. Now click on the “<strong>Open Panel</strong>“ tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-open-panel.jpg"                      alt="open panel"                ></p><p>9. The user interface is visible now. Kindly remember that, unlike DAW, the setting may not be applied until you hit the “<strong>OK</strong>“ or “<strong>Apply</strong>“ buttons. If “<strong>Apply automatically</strong>“ is selected, the settings will be displayed instantly, just as in DAW.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-apply-automatically.jpg"                      alt="apply automatically"                ></p><h2 id="Method-3-Increase-volume-by-Chrome-Volume-Booster-Plugin"><a href="#Method-3-Increase-volume-by-Chrome-Volume-Booster-Plugin" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin"></a>Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin</h2><p>Another effective way to increase volume without any hassle is by using the Chrome extension. For this purpose, the Volume Master extension serves to boost volume without affecting audio quality. This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.</p><p>With a simple slider, the usability and convenience of this extension are impressive. Through this, you can enhance, reduce, or increase the volume of a specific tab without affecting the default web browser or system volume settings.</p><p>There are three steps to increase volume by using the chrome booster volume plugin.</p><p>1. First, open <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, then move to <strong>Chrome Web Store</strong>. By searching the <strong>Volume Master</strong> here, you will be directed to the link which will open the extension page. Here hit the <strong>Add to Chrome button</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-add-volume-master.jpg"                      alt="add volume master"                ></p><p>2. A dialogue box will appear. When requested, click the <strong>Add Extension</strong> button to confirm.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-add-extension.jpg"                      alt="add extension"                ></p><p>3. Click on the extension icon in the right top corner after adding the extension. Now set the volume how much you want it to be boosted as shown in the mentioned slider.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/17-volume-booster-plugin.jpg"                      alt="volume booster plugin"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Edit-your-audio-with-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Edit-your-audio-with-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora"></a>Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora</h2><p>Wondershare Filmora is a comprehensive all-in-one video editor.
