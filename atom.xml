So all you have to do is make sure that all Adobe applications, including the Adobe Premiere Pro, are closed and then go to the location at which these folders are stored and change their names to <strong>Media Cache Files_OLD</strong> and <strong>Media Cache_OLD</strong>.

Once installed, launch the software. To create a new project, tap on the “New Project” button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-1.jpg"                      alt="make a new project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Import from File Tab</strong></p><p>Once a new window opens, three different methods can be used to import audio on Filmora.

Once installed, launch the software. To create a new project, tap on the “New Project” button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-1.jpg"                      alt="make a new project"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Import from File Tab</strong></p><p>Once a new window opens, three different methods can be used to import audio on Filmora. Tap on “File” to select the option of “Import Media Files” from “Import Media” in the drop-down menu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-2.jpg"                      alt="use file tab to import audio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Import from Import Button</strong></p><p>The second method calls up users to import audio through a button. The user needs to tap on the “Import Media Files Here” button to add audio in Filmora directly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on import button"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Import by Drag and Drop</strong></p><p>Users can import audios on Filmora in another way. They can drag and drop the audio files directly on the platform and perform functions using different tools.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static.wondershare.com/images-filmora/images/article/fix-audio-importing-issues-4.jpg"                      alt="drag and drop audio file"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If the methods of fixing the audio importing issues in Adobe Premiere Pro we presented in this article don’t help you solve this problem, you should consider reinstalling the OS on your computer.

Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p><h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories.

Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p><p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach.

According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p><p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide.

Tips and Tricks to Avoid Hiss and Reverb Noise</strong></h2><p>The problem of hissing sound and reverb noise usually comes from the equipment itself. However, some background noise may add to the problem. Making a few adjustments to the recording stage may help in reducing hiss and background noise:</p><ul><li><strong>Optimize the Recording Space</strong></li></ul><p>The noise-producing items in your recording space may add to the hissing noise in your audio. While most of the noise may seem innocent, they may amplify themselves when listening to the recorded footage. Optimizing your space before you start, such as closing the windows and doors or turning off your electronic devices will help to reduce the noise.</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce Subject-to-Microphone Distance</strong></li></ul><p>Keeping the microphone as close as possible to the subject will drastically improve the speech-to-noise ratio. The microphone will record more of the subject’s voice than the background noise, giving you a clearer audio output.</p><ul><li><strong>Use a Microphone with Gain-Boost</strong></li></ul><p>An enhanced gain microphone preamp helps to reduce hiss and notice from the audio in an incredible way. Specifically, the camera’s preamplifier does not add gain because the volume setting is kept low.</p><ul><li><strong>Use Directional Microphones</strong></li></ul><p>Usually, microphones signal outside their axis. This is often the case for cardioid polar and short gun patterns. This quality is great for reducing noise when you use directional microphones. The microphone will only focus on what you are interested in, ignoring the background noise.</p><ul><li><strong>Turn Off Camera’s Auto-Gain</strong></li></ul><p>The AGC or Auto Gain Control feature is popular in modern cameras. It automatically adjusts the gain for low- and high-volume sounds to make them even. However, it can enhance everything for a quiet setting, causing hissing background noise. Turning the feature off gives you more control over what sounds to focus on.</p><ul><li><strong>Reduce the Number of Open Microphones</strong></li></ul><p>Open microphones will continue recording audio even when you are not interested in that sound. Keeping this number low will help reduce hissing sound by focusing only on what you are recording.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Hiss and reverb background noise is an annoying problem.

Audio Hiss: What is it and Why Remove it"></a><strong>Part 1. Audio Hiss: What is it and Why Remove it</strong></h2><p>A hiss is a broadband noise across the audible spectrum of your audio. It becomes more intense in high frequencies, affecting the quality of the vocals and instrumentals in your audio. A hiss could sound like blue noise and is often caused by the electronic components themselves, which is referred to as self or inherent noise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-reverb-from-audio-tips-and-tricks-1.JPG"                      alt="hiss in audio"                ></p><p>A hiss is measured by decibels and is usually difficult to avoid because it is produced by electronic components. You will usually hear the hiss as air that is getting out of a narrow passage. You may also hear a reverb, which is a sound that occurs in space and sends sound waves out in all directions. Since this is a component of the original recording, it is impossible to delete it. However, hiss reduction is possible with the right editing software.</p><h3 id="Causes-of-Hiss-in-Audio-Recordings-1"><a href="#Causes-of-Hiss-in-Audio-Recordings-1" class="headerlink" title="Causes of Hiss in Audio Recordings"></a><strong>Causes of Hiss in Audio Recordings</strong></h3><ul><li>Electronic components such as microphones, video cameras, and interfaces create self-noise because of the heat energy created by the moving parts</li><li>Audio circuits generate self-noise, with the noise floor being the level of the inherent noise in the circuit</li><li>Screening and quality of electronic components, which cheap and poorly made equipment producing more hiss</li><li>Poor-quality audio cables contribute to hiss and hum when they are picked up during recording</li></ul><h3 id="Importance-of-Removing-Hiss-for-a-Professional-Sound-1"><a href="#Importance-of-Removing-Hiss-for-a-Professional-Sound-1" class="headerlink" title="Importance of Removing Hiss for a Professional Sound"></a><strong>Importance of Removing Hiss for a Professional Sound</strong></h3><p>Removing hiss from audio is important for a professional sound because it makes the sound clearer and polished.

Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places</strong></p><p>The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.</p><p>A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.</p><p>After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?</p><p>Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Record A Test</strong></p><p>After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.</p><p>Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording</strong></p><p>After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating&#x2F;cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.</p><p>Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.</p><p>Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online"></a>Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online</h2><p><strong>1.Can Background Noise Be Removed From Audio</strong></p><p>Yes, the background can be removed from audio easily nowadays, whether it’s after you’ve done recording or before recording audio; there are plenty of online software and applications, both available for your PC and smartphones.</p><p>These can help you get rid of the unwanted noise from your audio—some of the best online websites that can help you achieve that have been reviewed above. Choose the one that meets your needs!</p><p><strong>2. Is There Anything I Can Do To Prevent Noisy Audio Before I Record?</strong></p><p>Prior to recording, it is essential to reduce any acoustic noise sources if at all feasible. During recording, airflow may cause havoc on microphone preamplifiers, resulting in artifacts that may be difficult to remove.</p><p>Be careful to utilize adequate windscreens on your microphones, mainly when recording outside. Sound sources such as wind noise, for example, may frequently be discovered and appropriately eliminated by giving them a cursory listen via headphones.</p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Remove Background Noise Online</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Tips For Removing Background Noise From Audio BEFORE You Record</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Audio-Noise-And-Why-Is-It-Harmful-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Audio-Noise-And-Why-Is-It-Harmful-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Audio Noise And Why Is It Harmful?"></a>Part 1: What Is Audio Noise And Why Is It Harmful?</h2><p>No definition exists for audio noise; however, it is often defined as background noises such as fans, people chatting, automobiles or trucks going by, buzzing from broken audio wiring, or other ambient sounds that should not be included in your film.

Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places</strong></p><p>The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.</p><p>A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.</p><p>After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?</p><p>Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Record A Test</strong></p><p>After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.</p><p>Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording</strong></p><p>After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating&#x2F;cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.</p><p>Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.</p><p>Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online-1"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online"></a>Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online</h2><p><strong>1.Can Background Noise Be Removed From Audio</strong></p><p>Yes, the background can be removed from audio easily nowadays, whether it’s after you’ve done recording or before recording audio; there are plenty of online software and applications, both available for your PC and smartphones.</p><p>These can help you get rid of the unwanted noise from your audio—some of the best online websites that can help you achieve that have been reviewed above.

Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places</strong></p><p>The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.</p><p>A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.</p><p>After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?</p><p>Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: Record A Test</strong></p><p>After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.</p><p>Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording</strong></p><p>After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating&#x2F;cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.</p><p>Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.</p><p>Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.</p><h2 id="Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online-3"><a href="#Part-4-FAQs-About-Removing-Audio-Noise-From-Video-Online-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online"></a>Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online</h2><p><strong>1.Can Background Noise Be Removed From Audio</strong></p><p>Yes, the background can be removed from audio easily nowadays, whether it’s after you’ve done recording or before recording audio; there are plenty of online software and applications, both available for your PC and smartphones.</p><p>These can help you get rid of the unwanted noise from your audio—some of the best online websites that can help you achieve that have been reviewed above. Choose the one that meets your needs!</p><p><strong>2. Is There Anything I Can Do To Prevent Noisy Audio Before I Record?</strong></p><p>Prior to recording, it is essential to reduce any acoustic noise sources if at all feasible. During recording, airflow may cause havoc on microphone preamplifiers, resulting in artifacts that may be difficult to remove.</p><p>Be careful to utilize adequate windscreens on your microphones, mainly when recording outside. Sound sources such as wind noise, for example, may frequently be discovered and appropriately eliminated by giving them a cursory listen via headphones.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><h2 id="The-Seas-of-Sound-Enhancing-Skype-Chats-and-Fortnite-Games-with-Clownfish-Inspired-Audio-Effects"><a href="#The-Seas-of-Sound-Enhancing-Skype-Chats-and-Fortnite-Games-with-Clownfish-Inspired-Audio-Effects" class="headerlink" title="The Seas of Sound: Enhancing Skype Chats and Fortnite Games with Clownfish-Inspired Audio Effects"></a>The Seas of Sound: Enhancing Skype Chats and Fortnite Games with Clownfish-Inspired Audio Effects</h2><p>Want to do something interesting?

Solution to Fix Clownfish Voice Changer Not Working"></a>Part 4. Solution to Fix Clownfish Voice Changer Not Working</h2><p>While using Clownfish Voice Changer, you might also come across some troubles. They might be because either the voice changer is not updated, or maybe the apps you are using are not up to date. Let us share some fixes with you for smooth Clownfish functioning.</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Update-Clownfish-Voice-Changer-3"><a href="#Fix-1-Update-Clownfish-Voice-Changer-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1: Update Clownfish Voice Changer"></a>Fix 1: Update Clownfish Voice Changer</h3><p>The most significant reason why you face trouble is that your Clownfish version is outdated. For this, you should update the voice changer to its latest version by following the steps given below:</p><p>Step 1: You have to start by opening the ‘Control Panel’ from the ‘Run’ window. For that, press ‘Windows and R’ together and then type ‘Control’ and press ‘Enter.’ Now, look for the ‘Programs’ section, and under that section, click on the ‘Uninstall a Program.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-12.jpg"                      alt="tap on uninstall a program"                ></p><p>Step 2: A list of all the installed programs will appear on the screen. From that list, look for ‘Clownfish Voice Changer’ and then left-click on it. Lastly, select the option of ‘Uninstall.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-13.jpg"                      alt="click on uninstall button"                ></p><p>Step 3: Once this is done successfully, head over to the <a class="link"   href="https://clownfish-translator.com/voicechanger/download.html" >official website of Clownfish Voice Changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and install the latest version. Restart your computer and open the application to check if the problem has been resolved or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-14.jpg"                      alt="download clownfish latest version"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Check-the-Application’s-Version-3"><a href="#Fix-2-Check-the-Application’s-Version-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2: Check the Application’s Version"></a>Fix 2: Check the Application’s Version</h3><p>Another reason that might be causing the problem is an incompatible version of the application with Clownfish. Both the voice changer and the application must have compatible versions. You can take assistance from the steps below to check the version of Skype.</p><p>Step 1: Start by opening Skype, and then from the left menu pane, click on your Skype profile. Then, from the quick access menu list, look for the ‘Settings’ option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-15.jpg"                      alt="open skype settings"                ></p><p>Step 2: After the ‘Settings’ window opens, click on the ‘Help &amp; Feedback’ option once located from the left pane. As the Help &amp; Feedback screen opens, you will see the Skype logo on the screen, and under the logo, you will see the version of Skype.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/clownfish-voice-changer-16.jpg"                      alt="confirm skype version"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Microphone-Installation-in-Clownfish-3"><a href="#Fix-3-Microphone-Installation-in-Clownfish-3" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3: Microphone Installation in Clownfish"></a>Fix 3: Microphone Installation in Clownfish</h3><p>The Voice changer is of no use if the microphone cannot be used as a microphone is an essential component for using a voice changer.

For many creators, the concern for <strong>how to write podcast scripts</strong> that attract listeners involves adding sound effects. Doing so improves the quality of the audio content and appeals to listeners.</p><p>The dynamic <strong>sound effects for podcasts</strong> can help highlight specific moments&#x2F;reactions&#x2F;information, add to the atmospheric feel of the show, or prepare a unique intro tune.

Here are some of the best benefits you can expect from inserting sound effects for podcasts:</p><ul><li><strong>Thematic or mood setting</strong></li></ul><p>With a sound effect, you can portray a specific theme for your podcast that gives the users an instant feel of your brand&#x2F;channel. For example, if a podcaster is creating a podcast show for the True Crime genre, spooky and moody background sound effects set the mood. Comedy or commentary podcasts can use mood-based sound effects like a laugh track with their content.</p><ul><li><strong>Point emphasis</strong></li></ul><p>Many podcasters utilize sound effects at pivotal moments of their content, e.g., to emphasize a cliffhanger in story-form podcast episodes. Like the boding and italicizing methods are useful in text documents to emphasize parts, you can adjust sound effects to do the same for your audio-based content. These can accentuate the dialogue and evoke specific emotional responses from the audience.</p><ul><li><strong>Transition points</strong></li></ul><p>Most podcasters utilize the <strong>best sound effects for podcast</strong> shows to act as a transition between conversational segments. For example, some use these effects as outros or intros.</p><p>Now that you are clear about the expected benefits, which platform should you turn to for many quality sound effects?

As you drag the slider the new audio volume value is going to be displayed in a box below the slider. The <strong>left&#x2F;right balance value</strong> can be adjusted by <strong>dragging the knob</strong> that is located above the volume slider in either direction. Alternatively, you can <strong>insert a new numerical value in the box</strong> below the knob. If the displayed value is <strong>0 dB, then the left and right channels are balanced</strong>, while the value of <strong>-100 dB</strong> means that all the sound goes through the left channel and if the displayed value is <strong>100 dB</strong> all the sound will go through the right channel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stereo-mode.jpg"                      alt="stereo-mode"                ></p><h4 id="4-Adding-Keyframes-to-Adjust-the-Audio-Volume"><a href="#4-Adding-Keyframes-to-Adjust-the-Audio-Volume" class="headerlink" title="4.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="“Escaping-Through-Ethernet-An-Exclusive-List-of-Websites-that-Promote-Serenity-“"><a href="#“Escaping-Through-Ethernet-An-Exclusive-List-of-Websites-that-Promote-Serenity-“" class="headerlink" title="“Escaping Through Ethernet: An Exclusive List of Websites that Promote Serenity “"></a>“Escaping Through Ethernet: An Exclusive List of Websites that Promote Serenity “</h2><p>Our daily lives are filled with a lot of events that can lead to a lot of stress and agitation. Working on a particular project with a certain client to meet a looming deadline can be an important part of your job. Many solutions are available, but what happens when you’re working on your computer and have no spare time? This is where the Internet comes in handy.</p><p>Several websites exist that will assist you in achieving a sense of inner peace. Among other things, they use captivating images and soothing sounds to accomplish this. Here are the 10 best calming websites that could help you relax those nerves if you feel like you could use some quick and effective relaxation. We are sure that if you try these websites, they will help you a lot.</p><h3 id="1-Calm"><a href="#1-Calm" class="headerlink" title="1.Calm"></a>1.<a class="link"   href="http://www.calm.com/" >Calm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/calm-poster.png"                      alt="calm-poster"                ></p><p>The name itself suggests that Calm can help you achieve your goals. There are two ways to get there: guided calm or timer. A session can last anywhere from two to twenty minutes. You will hear a voice guide you on how to relax tense muscles and the mind when you choose the guided calm option. Alternatively, you can use the “timer” button to conduct a quick session without narration.</p><p>In addition to the music, the nature scenes depicted, such as misty riverside scenes and rays of sunlight streaming through clouds, add an extra touch. You can also download the Calm iPhone app for free but it will have limited features.</p><h3 id="2-Do-Nothing-For-2-Minutes"><a href="#2-Do-Nothing-For-2-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="2.Do Nothing For 2 Minutes"></a>2.<a class="link"   href="http://www.donothingfor2minutes.com/" >Do Nothing For 2 Minutes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster.png"                      alt="do-nothing-for-2-minutes-poster"                ></p><p>Its title speaks for itself. There won’t be any other activity for two minutes except listening to the waves. The purpose of this website is to test your ability to resist doing nothing. If you touch your keyboard or mouse, you will get a failure message, and the clock will reset again if you do. The majority of people fail several times before they complete the task. It is quite fun and challenging at the same time. While you focus on completing the challenge, you will forget all the worries on your mind.</p><p>Taking a quick break of 2 minutes can sometimes be all you need to reset your mind. It’s also available as an app (for iOS).</p><h3 id="3-Multiplayer-Piano"><a href="#3-Multiplayer-Piano" class="headerlink" title="3.Multiplayer Piano"></a>3.<a class="link"   href="https://multiplayerpiano.com/" >Multiplayer Piano <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/multiplayer-piano-poster.png"                      alt="multiplayer-piano-poster"                ></p><p>You can play multiplayer piano online. In the end, everyone plays simultaneously, and it’s crazy but fun. Both your mouse and keyboard can be used. Also available on the site are the possibilities of starting a chat with some random ‘composers’ or playing by yourself. If you don’t want to play in multiplayer mode, you can switch to solo mode. You can also record the piano that you play and then listen to it. Overall this website is quite fun.</p><h3 id="4-Simply-Noise"><a href="#4-Simply-Noise" class="headerlink" title="4.Simply Noise"></a>4.<a class="link"   href="http://simplynoise.com/" >Simply Noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/simply-noise-poster.png"                      alt="simply-noise-poster"                ></p><p>Relax with this free color noise generator. Using an audio spectrum of low to high frequencies, the site offers a variety of colored noises. Each color represents a different sound and calming effect, with white being the softest and pink being the loudest. Keeping your workspace white prevents distractions, pink sounds like a calming waterfall, and brown is good for sleeping and relieving migraines. You can control the volume using either the volume knob or the oscillation button, automatically changing the volume.</p><h3 id="5-Get-Relaxed"><a href="#5-Get-Relaxed" class="headerlink" title="5.Get Relaxed"></a>5.<a class="link"   href="https://getrelaxed.com/" >Get Relaxed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-relaxed-poster.png"                      alt="get-relaxed-poster"                ></p><p>Trying GetRelaxed might be the answer you’re looking for if sitting still for 2 minutes doesn’t appeal to you. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the beautiful images in the slideshow (the images change every three seconds). Choose from several soundscapes to complete the experience. A total of 15 soundscapes are available. They last between two and four minutes. You might be surprised by how easy it is to get back in touch with nature.</p><h3 id="6-Naturesoundsfor-me"><a href="#6-Naturesoundsfor-me" class="headerlink" title="6.Naturesoundsfor.me"></a>6.<a class="link"   href="http://naturesoundsfor.me/" >Naturesoundsfor.me <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/naturesoundsfor-me-poster.png"                      alt="naturesoundsfor-me-poster"                ></p><p>There are more than four kinds of sounds to choose from with naturesoundsfor.me: tribal drums, animals, fireworks, heartbeats, etc. Using a combination of different sounds like beach, child, and water, etc. You can easily create sounds according to your preferences. Create your own! Listening to the sound of the waves gently crashing on the shore as children giggle in the background is soothing yet lively. It can also be downloaded and played when you’re offline.</p><h3 id="7-A-Soft-Murmur"><a href="#7-A-Soft-Murmur" class="headerlink" title="7.A Soft Murmur"></a>7.<a class="link"   href="https://asoftmurmur.com/" >A Soft Murmur <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/a-soft-murmur-poster.png"                      alt="a-soft-murmur-poster"                ></p><p>An easy-to-use website that lets you mix ambient noises to your liking. A special mix can include the soothing sounds of rain, singing bowls, and my favorite, the sound of a fireplace. The ambient noises can be played simultaneously, or you can pick and choose as you need. Focusing on the task at hand will be easier with the sounds. Alternatively, you can share your mix on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram if you’d like.</p><h3 id="8-Noisli"><a href="#8-Noisli" class="headerlink" title="8.Noisli"></a>8.<a class="link"   href="https://www.noisli.com/" >Noisli <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://picsum.photos/960/420"                      alt="XXXXXXXXXXXXX"                ></p><p>Various background noises are produced on this website, including coffee shop chatter, low fan sound, white noise, and more. Depending on your mood, you can adjust the volume of the sounds. You can also change the color of the web page depending on the mood of the sound you have selected.</p><p>For those who love multitasking, there’s also a Text Editor function so they can write without distractions. You can even save your work. Additionally, Noisli offers an app (iOS) so you can stay calm no matter where you are.</p><h3 id="9-Focus-Will"><a href="#9-Focus-Will" class="headerlink" title="9.Focus@Will"></a>9.<a class="link"   href="https://home.focusatwill.com/" >Focus@Will <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/focus-will-poster.png"                      alt="focus-will-poster"                ></p><p>Focus@Will is awesome! When you read, write, or study while listening to phase-sequenced instrumental music, your attention span is increased by 400 percent. In addition, it extends the standard productivity cycle from 20 to 30 minutes to approximately 100 minutes.</p><p>It engages your background attention such that you don’t notice it interfering with your conscious focus on the task you’re working on (Alpha Chill works for me). As far as the costs are concerned, there are three account types to choose from: Guest, Personal, and Pro.</p><h3 id="10-Raining-fm"><a href="#10-Raining-fm" class="headerlink" title="10.Raining.fm"></a>10.<a class="link"   href="https://raining.fm/" >Raining.fm <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/raining-fm-poster.png"                      alt="raining-fm-poster"                ></p><p>Occasionally, all we need to soothe ourselves is a little rain. Listening to rain sounds on Raining.fm helps you relax. There is no way to tell that this is looped audio because it is so well done. A quick break reminder, an image slideshow, and a timer to silence the sound are also included.</p><p>When it’s time to stretch your legs and take a quick break, the reminder will let you know. Both iOS and Android users can download the Raining.fm app.</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict"><a href="#Final-Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a><strong>Final Verdict</strong></h2><p>If you are feeling stressed due to your daily hectic routine or facing focus issues, all you may need is a little escape.

Very few people think of audio editing when they talk about AE, even though this application offers a simple way to add Fade in and fade out effects to audio files used in soundtracks.</p><p>However, you will need to have at least basic video and sound editing skills to fade in and fade out audio files in AE since the app doesn’t offer a preset that you can drag and drop to the timeline. So, in this article, we will show how to create the Fade in and fade out effects in Adobe After Effects in just a few simple steps.</p><p> <strong>Read More to Get:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Best Audio Mixer Software to Trim Your Sound Easily &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE"><a href="#Adding-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-to-Audio-Files-in-AE" class="headerlink" title="Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE"></a>Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE</h2><h3 id="Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Step-1-Check-audio-waveform-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects"></a>Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects</h3><p>Once you’ve created a new project in AE and you’ve imported the audio files you’d like to include in the soundtrack of the video you’re making, you should place that audio file on the timeline. Click on the arrow located next to the audio file, then click on the Audio arrow that will be displayed under the file, and finally click on the Waveform arrow. This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you’d like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision. The file you added to your composition will be displayed as a layer in the Composition tab located in the lower-left region of the software’s interface.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fade-out-in-audio-after-effects-waveform.jpg" alt="fade out/in audio waveform after effects"></p><h3 id="Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file"><a href="#Step-2-Add-a-keyframe-to-the-audio-file" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file"></a>Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file</h3><p>The next thing you will have to do is place the playhead at the exact location where you want the Fade In effect to start. In most cases, Fade effects are added at the starting point of the audio file, so you should position the playhead at the beginning of the timeline or zero seconds.

Set the Audio Level value to 0db, and that is it. You’ve created the Fade in effect. Keep in mind that you can use more than two keyframes to fade in audio, enabling you to increase the audio level gradually. The process of creating the Fade effect requires you to add a keyframe that has a 0db value a few seconds before the clip ends and then add another keyframe at the very end of the audio file that has -50 or -100db audio level value.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/complete-fade-iin-out-audio-after-effects.jpg" alt="Complete fade out/in audio in After Effects"></p><h2 id="Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-3"><a href="#Tips-For-Making-Better-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects"></a>Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects</h2><p>The process of creating a fade in or a fade out effect in AE is quite simple, but it is up to you to discover creative ways of using these effects. Here are a few tips that can help you use these audio effects more creatively.</p><h3 id="1-Avoid-Hard-Cuts-3"><a href="#1-Avoid-Hard-Cuts-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Avoid Hard Cuts"></a>1. Avoid Hard Cuts</h3><p>A high pitch sound at the very begging of a new sequence can ruin your soundtrack and ultimately the entire video, so in case you’ve cut an audio file at the location where the sound peaks, you can apply a fade in effect to make the transition between two audio files softer.</p><p>You may also like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Cut Video in After Effects <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression-3"><a href="#2-Be-Mindful-of-Audio-Compression-3" class="headerlink" title="2.

Be Mindful of Audio Compression</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://theproaudiofiles.com/compression-techniques/" >Audio compression <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a process that reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet sounds, resulting from the audio file’s dynamic range being compressed. In most cases, you won’t notice the effects of audio compression, but if you compress an audio file too much, you might get some unwanted side effects if you add a fade out effect to that file. That’s why it is best to rely on the default audio compression features a video or audio editing app offers.</p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively-3"><a href="#3-Use-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effects-Creatively-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively"></a>3. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively</h3><p>Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn’t require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value. However, finding the best way to improve the quality of your soundtrack by applying these effects may take some practice. Do you often add Fade in and fade out audio effects in AE?
