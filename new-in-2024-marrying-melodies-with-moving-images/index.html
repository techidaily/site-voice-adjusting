What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?"></a>Part 1. What Factors Make Your Sound Unique and Special?</h2><p>Naturally, a person’s voice changes with time. Although time is not only the reason, the environment also plays an essential role in changing voice. The environment has a significant effect on the way someone walks, talks, or even how someone acts on something. There are various factors upon which your voice sounds unique and special; some of these factors are briefly discussed below:</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<h3 id="1-Gender"><a href="#1-Gender" class="headerlink" title="1. Gender"></a>1. Gender</h3><p>Females have small vocal cords as compared to males since birth. Then at puberty, the rise in the testosterone level causes the larynx to enlarge, and that changes your voice. Over time, the vocal cords thicken and tighten, which creates a vibration in sound along with deeper resonance. For females, the cords do not get tight, which results in a high pitch in the female voice.</p>
<h3 id="2-Structure-of-Anomalies"><a href="#2-Structure-of-Anomalies" class="headerlink" title="2. Structure of Anomalies"></a>2. Structure of Anomalies</h3><p>The structure of anomalies is referred to as cleft palates deviated spectrum. Anomalies affect the clearness that is in a person’s voice. The structure of one’s voice can be altered by the age, overall health, cleanliness, and emotional state of a person. Alongside the texture of sound, pitch and timbre can also change your voice.</p>
<h3 id="3-Body-Structure"><a href="#3-Body-Structure" class="headerlink" title="3. Body Structure"></a>3. Body Structure</h3><p>Bodyweight plays a vital role in changing voice. Obese men produce excessive estrogen that causes a rise in their voices. On the contrary, obese women have excessive testosterone that makes their voice deeper than others. Being obese makes the breath control better that results in generating a raspy sound.</p>
<h3 id="4-Height"><a href="#4-Height" class="headerlink" title="4. Height"></a>4. Height</h3><p>Underweight people have less endurance which increases the chance of injury to vocal cords. In comparison, heightened people have comparatively bigger lungs and larger lower airways, causing them to produce deeper voices compared to short people.</p>
<h3 id="5-Heredity"><a href="#5-Heredity" class="headerlink" title="5. Heredity"></a>5. Heredity</h3><p>Heredity and genetics play an important role in shaping your voice as it is a part of your anatomy too. Genetics is why you might find people from the same family have similar voices. Sound is made by the vocal cords that are in the larynx. The larynx is given a genetic code, which alters itself over time. These alterations, as a reaction, change your voice.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-in-Practice"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Change-Your-Voice-in-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?"></a>Part 2. How to Change Your Voice in Practice?</h2><p>There are multiple reasons why someone wants to change their voice. Someone might not be satisfied with their low pitch voice or want to have a deeper voice. At the same time, you might also want to change your voice to any frictional character. Or you might want to change your voice to Morgan freeman too.</p>
<p>The real question is ‘Can you change your voice?’. Yes, it is possible. There are a lot of ways to do it, but they differ in complexity and effectiveness. You can either use any voice changer, or else you can also choose the natural way, which is a long-term approach. A few ways to change your voice in practice are discussed below:</p>
<h3 id="Change-the-Way-you-Talk"><a href="#Change-the-Way-you-Talk" class="headerlink" title="Change the Way you Talk"></a>Change the Way you Talk</h3><p>Expressions change the emotions that affect the voice. Nasal and non-nasal voices differ as the nasal voices have a higher pitch as compared to non-nasal sounds. Changing the accent also affects the voice. The voice apparently stays the same, but the hearings of words change to make others feel the change of voice—for example, American and British accents.</p>
<h3 id="Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords"><a href="#Taking-Care-of-Vocal-Cords" class="headerlink" title="Taking Care of Vocal Cords"></a>Taking Care of Vocal Cords</h3><p>Taking care of vocal cords can help change your voice. Smoking causes loss of voice and lowers the range of voice. Screaming can damage the vocal cords that automatically affects the voice. Breathing in polluted air not only changes the voice but also damages the vocal cords.</p>
<h3 id="Vocal-Exercises"><a href="#Vocal-Exercises" class="headerlink" title="Vocal Exercises"></a>Vocal Exercises</h3><p>There are some exercises that relax the vocal cords. These exercises include massaging the throat to loosen tense muscles, humming, taking deep breaths. Another exercise is loosening the jaw by opening it wide and closing it gently. Lip buzzing, yawning, and tongue trills are also considered exercises for vocal cords that can change your voice.</p>

<h3 id="2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself"><a href="#2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself"></a>2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 &amp; Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.</p>

                      alt="load 3xosc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.</p>

<h3 id="2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-2"><a href="#2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself"></a>2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 &amp; Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.</p>

                      alt="load 3xosc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).</p>
<p><img

                      alt="vol subtab"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.</p>

<h3 id="2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-3"><a href="#2-Make-Bell-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself"></a>2. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 &amp; Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-6.jpg"
                      alt="load 3xosc"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="vol subtab"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant</p>

                      alt="tns button"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.</p>
