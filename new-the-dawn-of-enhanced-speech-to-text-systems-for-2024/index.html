<h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>The process of making a video has always been painstakingly long, and even though digital cameras and video editing apps that emerged in the last couple of decades have made this process somewhat easier, creating captions for videos you share online is still a time-consuming endeavor. Accessibility and better retrievability by search engines are among the most common reasons why video content producers choose to add captions to the videos they share on social media and video hosting platforms. If you are looking for a way to save some time on creating subtitles for your videos you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best speech to text platforms that enable you to generate captions in just a few minutes.</p>
<h2 id="Converting-Audio-to-Text"><a href="#Converting-Audio-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="Converting Audio to Text"></a>Converting Audio to Text</h2><p>Before we proceed any further we would like to note that the platforms and apps we featured in this article can only help you generate a subtitle file and that you are going to have to use a video editing software or an online subtitling platform to add that file to a video. Here are some of the best options for converting audio to text in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text"><a href="#1-IBM-Watson-Speech-to-Text" class="headerlink" title="1. IBM Watson Speech to Text"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://speech-to-text-demo.ng.bluemix.net/" >IBM Watson Speech to Text <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, different subscription plans available</p>
<p>Watson was initially created to answer questions on a popular quiz show called Jeopardy, and over time IBM developed a cloud-based version of the software that turns audio into text. The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.</p>
<p>Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p>
<h4 id="2-Sonix"><a href="#2-Sonix" class="headerlink" title="2. Sonix"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://sonix.ai/" >Sonix <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial, subscription plans start from $17.25 per month</p>
<p>This feature-rich platform is designed to help storytellers tell their stories. You can either upload audio or a video file and Sonix will generate a transcript of it in a remarkably short period of time, so you can transcribe a 30-minute audio file in less than five minutes. Transcriptions Sonix generates are not always a hundred percent accurate, but you can edit each word that this speech to text platform has generated in its Audio-Text editor.</p>
<p>Moreover, the platform is equipped with a video player so you can see your videos next to the transcript, which can be quite useful if you are trying to correct the misspellings and other mistakes. The best part is that Sonix has Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Audition integration, so you can add markers, metadata, captions or make rough cuts on both audio and video files you use in your projects.</p>
<h4 id="3-Amber-Script"><a href="#3-Amber-Script" class="headerlink" title="3. Amber Script"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.amberscript.com/en" >Amber Script <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free trial available, subscription plans start at $6 per hour of uploaded audio</p>
<p>Regardless of the pricing plan you choose, Amber Script lets you create text from audio files in 29 different languages. In addition, some pricing plans allow you to create text from both audio and video files, so you can easily make subtitles for your videos. Simply upload the file to Amber Script and the platform will generate the text for you. The text may not be entirely accurate, but you can easily make all corrections from the Amber Script’s text editor that offers speaker distinction and timestamp features. In case you don’t want to edit the text by yourself, you can choose a subscription plan that guarantees a 100% accuracy, as well as other advanced options. You can export the text in a variety of file formats, including commonly used text file formats such as SRT, json or docx, and use it for a wide array of purposes just minutes after you’ve transformed an audio file into text.</p>

<p>This free online converter lets you turn YouTube or any other type of video or audio file to text for free. You can upload a file directly from your computer, use a video’s URL if it is stored online or import it from personal cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive. Currently, you can only transcribe video and audio files that are in English, French, Hindi and Chinese languages which can limit your options if the text you’d like to generate is in another language. Keep in mind that you are going to have to specify the start and end points of the transcription which allows you to create text from only a portion of the video or audio file. Once the conversion is completed, you will have to wait for your request to be processed before you can download the text the platform generated for you.</p>

All the text the software generates will be displayed in the Results window where you can edit it, copy it to clipboard or save it as a text file. However, this software doesn’t provide support for video files, which means that you can’t use it to transcribe files that are saved in MP4, AVI, MOV or any other of the popular video file formats. You can try the Sobolsoft’s MP3 Speech to Text Converter for free and decide if you want to purchase the license to use the software without any restrictions.</p>

The speech to text functionality is just one out of many IBM’s Watson offers as you can also use it for machine learning or data analysis among numerous other things. You can create an account on IBM cloud for free, but if you decide to use this platform on a constant basis, then you will have to choose one of the available subscription plans.</p>
<p>Turning speech into text with Watson is easy, as you just have to pick a voice model, upload the audio file you saved in MP3, MPEG, wav, flac or opus file format and choose the keywords you’d like Watson to spot. Alternatively, you can use this platform to record audio files you’d like to convert to text, but you should keep in mind that Watson only supports French, German, Arabic, English, Korean, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Mandarin, French and Japanese languages.</p>

There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.</p>
<h3 id="1-Download-from-Some-YouTube-Video"><a href="#1-Download-from-Some-YouTube-Video" class="headerlink" title="1. Download from Some YouTube Video"></a>1. Download from Some YouTube Video</h3><p>This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="scary sound effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Afterward, click on your browser’s search bar and type &lt;<a href="http://www.y2mate.com>">www.y2mate.com&gt;</a>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page</p>

                      alt="download the effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png"
                      alt="options showed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="download the effect"
                ></p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Register an account</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Press download next to it.</p>
<p>Pretty straightforward, and as mentioned, these are free, but with limitations such as total download amount per month or licensing.</p>

Still, we will also teach you how to make your sound effects and add that good effect into your video or audio file.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Ways-to-Download-All-Kinds-of-Sound-Effect-3"><a href="#Part-1-Ways-to-Download-All-Kinds-of-Sound-Effect-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect"></a>Part 1 Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect</h2><p>Let’s get the first and probably the most important part out of the way, where to get scary scream sound effects. There are quite a few ways of doing so. We are sure you will find the desired method.</p>
<h3 id="1-Download-from-Some-YouTube-Video-3"><a href="#1-Download-from-Some-YouTube-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Download from Some YouTube Video"></a>1. Download from Some YouTube Video</h3><p>This one may not seem very obvious to people. Still, it is a very plausible way of downloading sound effects, but make sure that the audio clips uploaded are the original producer and have given explicit permission to use it. If not, you might want to get their permission first. Otherwise, you could get in trouble, which none of us would like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Firstly, go to you tube’s search bar on the top, and type in the name of the scary sounds mp3 effect you want, then type sound effect after it, and then press enter.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-5.png"
                      alt="scary sound"
                ></p>
<p>Doing so will show you a list of ‘videos’ that have the desired scary movie sound effects, but in reality, it will most likely be an audio clip with a still image.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Right-click on the video and press copy video URL.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-4.png"
                      alt="scary sound effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Afterward, click on your browser’s search bar and type &lt;<a href="http://www.y2mate.com>">www.y2mate.com&gt;</a>, then press enter, but be sure to use ad-block and anti-virus on such sites. On the website, press on the big search bar in the middle of the page</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-3.png"
                      alt="download the effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Copy the video URL into it by pressing control and v together or right-clicking and pressing paste.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/scary-sound-2.png"
                      alt="options showed"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Proceed to click on mp3 in the middle of the three options. There will be another list shown before you with only one choice this time.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Then press start. A list of options will be shown before you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="download the effect"
                ></p>
<p>That will download the entirety of the video in audio format only. All of this is free. Later in this article, we will show you how to cut and trim it.</p>
<h3 id="2-Make-Scary-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-3"><a href="#2-Make-Scary-Sound-Effect-by-Yourself-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself"></a>2. Make Scary Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>If you are not satisfied with other scary sound effects or want something unique, you can make your sound effects. Initially, get a good-quality microphone with a pop filter for clear audio.</p>
<p><strong>Be Sure To Be In a Quiet Room with Padding:</strong></p>
<p>Connect the microphone to your computer make sure it is unmuted physically by pressing its button, as some microphones have a mute button on them.</p>
<p><strong>Make Sure the Microphone Is Unmuted In the Software:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open a recording software, such as OBS Studio or audio recorder from Windows.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press record and make the sound effect you want.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> End the recording by pressing stop recording. You will now have recorded a scary music sound effect saved on your computer.</p>
<p>This method requires money for a good microphone, a pop filter, and padding.</p>
<h3 id="3-Getting-Sound-Effects-from-Free-Websites-3"><a href="#3-Getting-Sound-Effects-from-Free-Websites-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Getting Sound Effects from Free Websites"></a>3. Getting Sound Effects from Free Websites</h3><p>This option is attractive to many people, from beginners to people testing out the waters of audio editing. However, it should be noticed that the sound quality is not the best.</p>
<p>You can get free sound effects from websites such as Freesound.com or Soundeffectsplus.com.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all, go to the website.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Register an account</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Then search your desired sound effect</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="search the effect"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Press download next to it.</p>
<p>Pretty straightforward, and as mentioned, these are free, but with limitations such as total download amount per month or licensing.</p>
<h3 id="4-Buying-Sound-Effects-3"><a href="#4-Buying-Sound-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Buying Sound Effects"></a>4. Buying Sound Effects</h3><p>If you have money but not time to make your audio effects, you can buy sound effects off the internet. Usually, these sellers have excellent quality audio; they can even make specific sound effects tailored to your needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>Many websites sell sound effects, including the likes of – &lt;<a href="http://www.prosoundeffects.com>">www.prosoundeffects.com&gt;</a> and &lt;<a href="http://www.soundsnap.com>">www.soundsnap.com&gt;</a>.</li>
<li>Both websites are famous among the audio effects community; soundscape even provides audio for Nickelodeon, Disney, Pixar, HBO, and Netflix.</li>
<li>As per usual, you first register an account.</li>
<li>Once you are done with that, you buy the package you want, whether a one-time payment, bi-annual, or annual plan.</li>
<li>These plans have different terms, such as 150 downloads per 6 months. Make sure of the times you will buy before you confirm the purchase.</li>
<li>Then your search for the audio you want in the search bar</li>
<li>Afterward, you click download. That’s it! You got it.</li>

</ol>
<p>The best and the most effective way to get unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want is to use a VPN. VPN helps you access Omegle from a totally different location, making you a different individual to use Omegle. It masks your IP address and provides you with a virtual and temporary IP address to get access to Omegle. But there is a small disadvantage of using VPN, which is slow speed. If you plan to have video chats, this slow connection may hinder this process and get you to ban again for several drops. But you can simply refresh the VPN and access Omegle from a different location and get unbanned again.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Wait-for-some-time"><a href="#Wait-for-some-time" class="headerlink" title="Wait for some time"></a><strong>Wait for some time</strong></h4></li>

Another thing that can happen after few days is the change of your IP by your ISP because it often gets refreshed after every few days, providing you with a new IP address and a way to access Omegle again without any external IP support.</p>

This method can get you unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want. The main difference between a Proxy and VPN is data encryption. The proxy doesn’t encrypt your data. Everything else is similar in both of the methods.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Use-a-Different-Network"><a href="#Use-a-Different-Network" class="headerlink" title="Use a Different Network"></a><strong>Use a Different Network</strong></h4></li>

<h2 id="Common-Reasons-behind-the-Ban-3"><a href="#Common-Reasons-behind-the-Ban-3" class="headerlink" title="Common Reasons behind the Ban"></a>Common Reasons behind the Ban</h2><p>There are several different reasons behind being banned from Omegle, but we will inform you about the most common ones that cause most of the bans in this article.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="When-you-Drop-the-Video-Calls-and-Chats-too-often-3"><a href="#When-you-Drop-the-Video-Calls-and-Chats-too-often-3" class="headerlink" title="When you Drop the Video Calls and Chats too often"></a><strong>When you Drop the Video Calls and Chats too often</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are the one who drops from the calls or chats after being connected with any stranger, then are chances that you will get banned very soon. Omegle is designed in such a way to notice the drops that occur, if these drops are too many the system will automatically ban your account. That’s why it is important to a stable connection while you are trying to connect someone and avoid dropping the calls and chats when you are connected with someone. The system of Omegle will perceive you as a scammer or troll.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="When-you-are-reported-by-another-user-3"><a href="#When-you-are-reported-by-another-user-3" class="headerlink" title="When you are reported by another user"></a><strong>When you are reported by another user</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the strange this that can happen to you on Omegle is being banned because of someone’s false accusations about you. If any other user reports you they will ban you straight away, without investigating the matter to find the truth behind the accusation. If someone doesn’t like you, your voice, your background, your slow internet connection, they can simply get you banned simply by reporting you. This system of reporting was designed to secure the safety of the users and help them avoid any kind of harassment and bully, but many users are using it in a negative and destructive way. To avoid such kind of ban, try to be as modest and as humble as you can with everyone you talk and get connected with.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Violating-Omegle’s-Terms-and-Conditions-3"><a href="#Violating-Omegle’s-Terms-and-Conditions-3" class="headerlink" title="Violating Omegle’s Terms and Conditions"></a><strong>Violating Omegle’s Terms and Conditions</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>There are so many conditions of Omegle to follow, and sometimes it feels like an impossible thing to follow all those terms and conditions. They can ban you from Omegle if you are playing copyright music while a video call, if there is a movie or TV show being played in the background, you will be banned from Omegle. Another thing is to avoid being abusive with other users and behaviors.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-get-Unbanned-from-Omegle-3"><a href="#How-to-get-Unbanned-from-Omegle-3" class="headerlink" title="How to get Unbanned from Omegle?"></a>How to get Unbanned from Omegle?</h2><p>If you still got banned from Omegle after avoiding all the reasons that can cause a ban, then there is no need to worry. Multiple ways can help you get unbanned from Omegle.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-get-unbanned-from-omegle-poster.jpg"
                      alt=" how-to-get-unbanned-from-omegle-poster"
                ></p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Use-a-VPN-3"><a href="#Use-a-VPN-3" class="headerlink" title="Use a VPN"></a><strong>Use a VPN</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>The best and the most effective way to get unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want is to use a VPN. VPN helps you access Omegle from a totally different location, making you a different individual to use Omegle. It masks your IP address and provides you with a virtual and temporary IP address to get access to Omegle. But there is a small disadvantage of using VPN, which is slow speed. If you plan to have video chats, this slow connection may hinder this process and get you to ban again for several drops. But you can simply refresh the VPN and access Omegle from a different location and get unbanned again.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Wait-for-some-time-3"><a href="#Wait-for-some-time-3" class="headerlink" title="Wait for some time"></a><strong>Wait for some time</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t want to use any trick to Omegle and wait for a few days, you should. Because some bans only last for few days. Another thing that can happen after few days is the change of your IP by your ISP because it often gets refreshed after every few days, providing you with a new IP address and a way to access Omegle again without any external IP support.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Use-Proxy-Service-3"><a href="#Use-Proxy-Service-3" class="headerlink" title="Use Proxy Service"></a><strong>Use Proxy Service</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>It is no different than a VPN. It allows you to access the websites from an intermediary IP address making it your temporary IP address. This method can get you unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want. The main difference between a Proxy and VPN is data encryption. The proxy doesn’t encrypt your data. Everything else is similar in both of the methods.</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 id="Use-a-Different-Network-3"><a href="#Use-a-Different-Network-3" class="headerlink" title="Use a Different Network"></a><strong>Use a Different Network</strong></h4></li>
</ol>
<p>Since the ban is not applied to the user, the IP address can simply be bypassed by changing the network you are using to access Omegle. Every network provides you with a different and Unique IP address. This could be anything, a mobile network, friend’s wifi, or public wifi. Changing the network can enable you to access Omegle immediately. Once your device is connected to a new network, your device is assigned to a new IP address making the Omegle access right away.</p>
<hr>
<h4 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>The System that Omegle uses to ban its users is very strict and automatically bans users without getting into the matter and investigating it. So using Omegle and not getting banned doesn’t seem to be a possible thing. But one can avoid being ban as long as possible by avoiding all the reasons described in this article. But if you are ban, it can easily be accessed by using any of the above methods.</p>
