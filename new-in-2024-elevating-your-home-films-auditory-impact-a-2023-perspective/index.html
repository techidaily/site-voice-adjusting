<p>It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import video clips into Filmora</p>
<p>Using the software is not a great deal, it’s one of the most basic things that one does, and the first step involves importing videos on Filmora. The import function can easily be seen and it’s pretty easy to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-the-video-clip.jpg"
                      alt="improve video sound quality"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cut, trim or split video (optional)</p>
<p>Secondly, you can opt to trim the video; however, this step is very optional. Sometimes the desire to perfect the whole video may be much and thus opt to improve the audio quality of the whole item.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Audio denoise</p>
<p>The third step is also the main function of the software, it allows you to remove the background noise (audio denoise) the sounds can also be removed by audio detach and mute. Having done this, you can be sure that the quality of your audio is perfected to what you may have initially desired.</p>

                      alt="How to improve video sound quality"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Adjust video volume, pitch, etc</p>
<p>With a perfect sound, you have to adjust the pitch, the volume, and other effects of the sound that you were improving; this is set to match your needs and the feeling of the desired groups.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add audio effect with Audio Equalizer</p>
<p>You can also opt to add an effect with Audio Equalizer, like dance, and bass as per your desire.</p>

<p>It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import video clips into Filmora</p>
<p>Using the software is not a great deal, it’s one of the most basic things that one does, and the first step involves importing videos on Filmora. The import function can easily be seen and it’s pretty easy to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="improve video sound quality"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cut, trim or split video (optional)</p>
<p>Secondly, you can opt to trim the video; however, this step is very optional. Sometimes the desire to perfect the whole video may be much and thus opt to improve the audio quality of the whole item.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Audio denoise</p>
<p>The third step is also the main function of the software, it allows you to remove the background noise (audio denoise) the sounds can also be removed by audio detach and mute. Having done this, you can be sure that the quality of your audio is perfected to what you may have initially desired.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Adjust video volume, pitch, etc</p>
<p>With a perfect sound, you have to adjust the pitch, the volume, and other effects of the sound that you were improving; this is set to match your needs and the feeling of the desired groups.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add audio effect with Audio Equalizer</p>
<p>You can also opt to add an effect with Audio Equalizer, like dance, and bass as per your desire.</p>

<p>It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import video clips into Filmora</p>
<p>Using the software is not a great deal, it’s one of the most basic things that one does, and the first step involves importing videos on Filmora. The import function can easily be seen and it’s pretty easy to use.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-the-video-clip.jpg"
                      alt="improve video sound quality"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cut, trim or split video (optional)</p>
<p>Secondly, you can opt to trim the video; however, this step is very optional. Sometimes the desire to perfect the whole video may be much and thus opt to improve the audio quality of the whole item.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Audio denoise</p>
<p>The third step is also the main function of the software, it allows you to remove the background noise (audio denoise) the sounds can also be removed by audio detach and mute. Having done this, you can be sure that the quality of your audio is perfected to what you may have initially desired.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-denoise.jpg"
                      alt="How to improve video sound quality"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Adjust video volume, pitch, etc</p>
<p>With a perfect sound, you have to adjust the pitch, the volume, and other effects of the sound that you were improving; this is set to match your needs and the feeling of the desired groups.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add audio effect with Audio Equalizer</p>
<p>You can also opt to add an effect with Audio Equalizer, like dance, and bass as per your desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="adjust video sound quality"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Add background music</p>
<p>With the software, you can elevate the level of your recording by adding some royalty music as the background.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-royalty-music-to-video.png"
                      alt="add music to enhance sound quality"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Mix audio</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-mixer.jpg"
                      alt="Mix audio track to improve sound quality"
                ></p>
<p>Lastly, mixing different tracks into one file with an audio mixer is a crucial last step in perfecting your video. When done, feel free to share the perfected video, you can import it to your desired destination.</p>

How to Add Audio to iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 1. How to Add Audio to iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> In your iMovie project, tap the <strong>ADD MEDIA</strong> (<strong>+</strong> Symbol) button.</p>
<p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Then, choose <strong>AUDIO</strong>.</p>
<p>You will now be given three options. Soundtracks, My Music, and Songs in iCloud. Make your choice.</p>
<p>To listen to a soundtrack, tap it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, and then hit it again to preview it.</p>
<p><strong>Step #3.</strong> To add a soundtrack to your project, hit the <strong>Add Audio</strong> icon next to it. iMovie will automatically insert the music at the beginning of the project and adjust it to match the duration of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Adding sound effects</strong></p>
<p>When you add a sound effect, it is linked to the video clip above it in the timeline. When you move the video clip, the sound effect moves with it. This differs from soundtracks, which are separate from the video segments in your production.</p>
<p>Scroll the timeline with your project open until the play head (the white vertical line) appears where you wish to add the sound effect.</p>
<p>To browse the built-in sound effects, press the <strong>Add Media</strong> button, then <strong>Audio</strong>, then <strong>Sound Effects</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Step #4.</strong> Adjust the volume of the clip</p>
<p>After you’ve added sound to your iMovie project, you may change the level of audio clips to achieve the ideal sound mix, or change the level of video clips that have sound. To change the volume of an audio or video clip, select it in the timeline, click the <strong>Volume</strong> button at the bottom of the window, and then drag the slider to raise or decrease the volume. When you completely reduce the volume of a clip, a <strong>Mute</strong> symbol displays on the clip in the timeline.</p>

How to Add Audio to iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 1. How to Add Audio to iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p><strong>Step #1.</strong> In your iMovie project, tap the <strong>ADD MEDIA</strong> (<strong>+</strong> Symbol) button.</p>
<p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Then, choose <strong>AUDIO</strong>.</p>
<p>You will now be given three options. Soundtracks, My Music, and Songs in iCloud. Make your choice.</p>
<p>To listen to a soundtrack, tap it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, and then hit it again to preview it.</p>
<p><strong>Step #3.</strong> To add a soundtrack to your project, hit the <strong>Add Audio</strong> icon next to it. iMovie will automatically insert the music at the beginning of the project and adjust it to match the duration of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Adding sound effects</strong></p>
<p>When you add a sound effect, it is linked to the video clip above it in the timeline. When you move the video clip, the sound effect moves with it. This differs from soundtracks, which are separate from the video segments in your production.</p>
<p>Scroll the timeline with your project open until the play head (the white vertical line) appears where you wish to add the sound effect.</p>
<p>To browse the built-in sound effects, press the <strong>Add Media</strong> button, then <strong>Audio</strong>, then <strong>Sound Effects</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Step #4.</strong> Adjust the volume of the clip</p>
<p>After you’ve added sound to your iMovie project, you may change the level of audio clips to achieve the ideal sound mix, or change the level of video clips that have sound. To change the volume of an audio or video clip, select it in the timeline, click the <strong>Volume</strong> button at the bottom of the window, and then drag the slider to raise or decrease the volume. When you completely reduce the volume of a clip, a <strong>Mute</strong> symbol displays on the clip in the timeline.</p>

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-1"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits-1" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>
<h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services-1"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services-1" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p>
<h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-1"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform-1" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free-1"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free-1" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-1"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-1" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p>

Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p>

If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p>
<p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p>
<h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free-2"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free-2" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p>
<h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-2"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services-2" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast. Each podcast hosting platform we included in this article ensures that your podcasts are delivered to all of your subscribers, but which one you are going to choose depends on a plethora of factors that range from a platform’s storage capacity to the number of podcast directories to which your podcasts are added.
